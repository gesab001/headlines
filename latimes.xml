County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

In San Clemente the local council voted to reopen the beach for recreational activity such as walking, running, swimming and surfing, but have also said residents should not bring a blanket and hang out starting Saturday morning at 6am. The city is attempting to limit access to local residents by keeping parking lots closed, and other Orange county officials have urged out-of-town residents not to visit the beaches and parks that remain open.

For decades, the South Central Family Health Center has been a refuge for low-income families most at risk. They rely on the clinic for medical help; also for help with homeless services, food coupons and emotional support for domestic violence. In recent weeks, so many patients have stopped attending the clinic due to Coronavirus fears, it's put the clinics funding at risk. Officials have furloughed employees, slashed services and put major projects on hold. They said worry that after the pandemic ends, the clinic may not be able to stay open or will only offer a fraction of the critical services it's known for.

"It takes a village to save a village," Coe said, "because we are the Laguna Woods Village." Orange County has signed a lease to use a Laguna Woods Hotel to house 19 homeless patients with coronavirus that some neighbors - mostly a retirement community - and city officials are opposing. The county is trying to meet Gov. Newsom's mandate to shelter homeless in motels and hotels in order to help combat spread of coronavirus. (Allen J.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[SANTA ANA, CA -- TUESDAY, APRIL 21, 2020: Mason Nakamura holds a photo of himself with his late mother, Mary Nakamura, at his home in Santa Ana, CA, on April 21, 2020. Mary Nakamura received her stimulus payment on April 15. There's just one problem, she's deceased. The 96-year-old died about a year ago but her son Mason Nakamura, who handles her estate account, said his mother received a $1200 check. He wants to give that money back to the IRS, saying it doesn't make sense. Nakamura's mother is likely one of thousands who are deceased but received payments anyway. IRS experts said it's actually lawful for the dead to get stimulus payments and that it's not an error. The priority was put on getting payments out as quickly as possible and weeding out the dead would have likely delayed the process by weeks, if not months. (Allen J.
