   <media:description>Several senior scientific advisers to the United Kingdom government have spoken publicly to say it is too soon to lift the country's lockdown.
That is even though the next stage to ease restrictions starts on Monday.
They say the decision is &quot;political&quot;.

   <media:description>For a fourth day, there have been violent protests across the United States, from New York to Los Angeles.
As night falls, curfews are now being enforced in more than a dozen cities.
Los Angeles, Atlanta, Portland and Denver are among those restricting movement to try and curb more violence.
But, in Minneapolis, people are again defying the orders and continuing to make their voices heard on the streets.
 
Al Jazeera has reporters standing by in four major cities: Al Jazeera's John Hendren is in Minneapolis, Gabriel Elizondo is in New York, Andy Gallacher is in Miami and Rob Reynolds is in Los Angeles.

   <media:description>Dozens of news producers who oversee MSN websites for Microsoft are being replaced by software. 
Media reports in Seattle, where the company is based, say around 50 news producers in both the US and Britain will not have their contracts renewed.
Microsoft says the decision is not related to the pandemic.

   <media:description>Doctors and nurses in Peru say hospitals cannot cope with the rising number of coronavirus infections and are demanding more government help.
Latin America's second hardest hit country has endured one of the world's longest mandatory lockdowns since March.
More than 1,300 doctors have been infected.
At least 141,000 infections have been reported and more than 4,000 deaths - including dozens of doctors.

   <media:description>Anger and unrest have spread across cities in the United States over the police killing of yet another unarmed African American.
Like others, the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis was caught on video and went viral online.
Images of police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes, leading to Floyd's death, sparked anger.
Crowds protested, demanding justice and attacking police and vehicles.
Police in riot gear fired tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray 
The violence in Minneapolis prompted a tweet from President Trump, who called protesters 'thugs', adding 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts'.
So, can the government contain the unrest this time around?
And is it able to deal with its root causes?

   <media:description>China has been rapidly rolling out its Belt and Road Initiative to build new roads, ports and rail lines in mostly developing nations, extending the country's reach across continents.

China says the infrastructure will benefit countries while critics say China is extending unfair influence over others.

Many nations have been rethinking their involvement amid accusations that China has overpriced projects.

Between 2000 and 2017, the world's debt obligations to China rose from $500bn to a staggering $5 trillion - about six percent of the world's economic output - according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

Researchers also found that China and its subsidiaries have lent $1.5 trillion directly to 150 nations - making China the world's biggest creditor, overtaking the IMF and World Bank. It has also made unreported loans worth $200bn.

We talk to Professor Christoph Trebesch from the Kiel Institute, who explains how China's opaque lending practices make it difficult for investors and international lenders to make accurate investment decisions.

The man behind a $1 trillion crash
On May 6, 2010, an unexplained glitch rattled the S&amp;P 500 stock market index, temporarily wiping $1 trillion off its value. 

In 2015, US authorities caught up with the man they blame for triggering the crash: Navinder Sarao, a day trader working out of his parents' West London home. Unknown to his family, he had amassed a $70m fortune.

We speak to financial journalist and author Liam Vaughan, who explains how Navinder Sarao's story may speak to deeper problems affecting high-frequency trading.

   <media:description>On The Listening Post this week: The pandemic gives big tech firms a chance to access the holy grail of datasets - your medical records. Plus, science journalists and their sources.

AI and our health data: A pandemic threat to our privacy

Put yourself in the shoes of the NHS, the United Kingdom's tax-payer funded public health service. You treat about a million patients every 36 hours and that is pre-pandemic. The amount of health data you are now churning out is enormous - and you want to harness that data in the fight against COVID-19.

So you turn to the private sector and get technology companies to help you do that. Seems to make sense, but here is the issue: Companies with chequered histories over data handling start landing those contracts. And, to date, the British government has refused to disclose the contractual terms.

Information does not get any more personal than your health data. And, in the midst of this pandemic, the British public has been left in the dark on where that data is going - and what these companies and the government might be able to do with it, down the road.

On our radar: 

Richard Gizbert speaks to producer Johanna Hoes about local television stations in the United States filing the exact same story on the world's largest retailer, Amazon and its handling of COVID-19 in the workplace - plus the major media players in Brazil who are boycotting Bolsonaro's briefings.

Science journalism in the spotlight

For months now, journalists around the world have been on a crash course in reporting on medical science. They had no experience in covering a pandemic and we have documented some of the shortcomings in their reporting. Now we are turning to journalists with some actual credentials in this field: Science and health reporters. In many cases, they were the first to recognise the dangers of the outbreak in Wuhan, leaving the rest of us to play catch up. Historically underappreciated, and usually underrepresented in newsrooms, science and health reporters now find their expertise is in demand. But their rise to prominence has been accompanied by a new level of scrutiny in the kind of work they do. And their critics are coming out of the woodwork. The Listening Post's Flo Phillips talks to three science journalists about the highs - and lows - of covering the COVID-19 pandemic.

   <media:description>Anger is boiling over in cities across the United States for a third consecutive night.
From coast to coast, and even outside the White House, protesters are demanding justice over the death of an unarmed Black man at the hands of a white police officer.
That officer, Derek Chauvin, has now been charged with George Floyd's murder, but it has done little to dampen the anger.

   <media:description>Coronavirus numbers in the United Kingdom may be heading lower, but charities say they are seeing a sharp rise in people needing their services.
Many were already struggling to get by before the pandemic.
Now, volunteers are trying to help parents with babies who cannot afford nappies, and others going days without food.

   <media:description>When the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, newly independent states emerged.

These new borders meant that all of a sudden people found themselves on the wrong side - foreigners in a country they called their home, but were unable to prove or formally claim as such.

The United Nations refugee agency estimates that at least 280 million people lost their citizenship during the formation of post-Soviet republics, including in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.

Nearly 30 years later, thousands across the region live without any legal trace - many of them having inherited their statelessness from their parents.

Azizbek Ashurov is a Kyrgyz lawyer, and founder of the Ferghana Lawyers Without Borders association. He has spent more than a decade fighting for the rights of thousands of stateless people in his country.

To access those in need, Ashurov and his team first had to figure out how many people lacked legal identity, and find ways to help them. With an estimated two-thirds of Kyrgyzstan's six million people living in rural areas, the team spent much of their time in the hills and villages of the Ferghana valley which spreads across parts of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

The work has had an effect.

The NGO has helped more than 10,000 stateless people in Kyrgyzstan gain citizenship, and some 2,000 children now have access to education, health and a more promising future.

Kyrgyzstan is now a leading example of how statelessness can be eradicated - there are no more known cases of people living there without a legal identity.

Talk to Al Jazeera travelled to Kyrgyzstan to meet Ashurov and some of the people he has helped.
