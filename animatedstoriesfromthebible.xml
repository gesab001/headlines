   <media:description>Job 1-42
Job is a wealthy man living in a land called Uz with his large family and extensive flocks. He is “blameless” and “upright,” with God. He is always careful to avoid doing evil. God boasts to Satan about Job's goodness, but Satan argues that Job is only good because God has blessed him abundantly. Satan challenges God that, if given permission to punish the man, Job will turn and curse God to his face. God allows Satan to torment Job to test this bold claim, but he forbids Satan to take Job’s life in the process. Job's faith stands firm. Because of that, God's blesses him with more than he had before.
