For decades, the South Central Family Health Center has been a refuge for low-income families most at risk. They rely on the clinic for medical help; also for help with homeless services, food coupons and emotional support for domestic violence. In recent weeks, so many patients have stopped attending the clinic due to Coronavirus fears, it's put the clinics funding at risk. Officials have furloughed employees, slashed services and put major projects on hold. They said worry that after the pandemic ends, the clinic may not be able to stay open or will only offer a fraction of the critical services it's known for.
