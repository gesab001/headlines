    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[OCEANO, CA - JULY 03, 2019 - The Oceano Dunes, a few miles south of Pismo Beach off Highway 1, are a major destination for off-roaders and campers, the bulk of them driving in from the Central Valley, Greater Los Angeles or the Bay Area. They arrive in trucks, trailers and RVs and other vehicles, motoring down a ramp onto the beach to access the âSand Highway,â to make camp July 3, 2019. Oceano Dunes State Park, one of the stateâs most popular parks draws about 2 million visitors a year. On busy weekends and holidays, reservations for its 1,000 sandy campsites fill up six months in advance. The California Coastal Commission is considering a move to scale back, and potentially eliminate, off-roading at the Oceano Dunes, the only state park on the California coast where you can still ride off-road vehicles. The decision stems from decades of controversy over off roading's impact on sensitive dune habitat, endangered birds and air quality for nearby residents.
