   <media:description>The Sabbath Day has always been Saturday according to the Bible. That's the seventh-day of the week. The Jews have always believed the Sabbath was Saturday. But Christians believe it is Sunday - who changed this and why does it matter so much?

The Bible predicts that a 'power' would change the 'times and the law'. This study will cover the gradual change of the Sabbath over the centuries. It will look at how it happened, why it happened, and who is behind this great deception. By the way, this 'power' is still operating today.

Have you ever been scammed? Did you know that one of the greatest scams in history has been bought by almost everyone on the planet? What is it? How can you and I avoid it? Don‚Äôt miss the answer in The Counterfeit.

CAMI OETMAN
Ten years ago, Cami Oetman had a real encounter with God that would change her life forever. She was a successful entrepreneur at the time, and the transition wasn‚Äôt easy. However, the truth Cami will share in this series was so compelling that she knew every human being in the world should experience the love of Jesus as she had.

Within three years, she had preached 350 Bible presentations. Today, as a vice president for Adventist World Radio, Cami travels the world documenting the miracles that take place when people give their hearts to Jesus.
It may seem difficult to imagine yourself understanding Bible prophecy. 

Cami couldn‚Äôt either. She had spent two decades in the modeling world ‚Äî in front of and behind the camera. She had also used her master‚Äôs degree in social work to care for hospice patients. She then started a successful retail business. But no one can predict how they will react when they have a real experience with God!

THE COUNTERFEIT
In Exodus 20:8-11, the Bible clearly states that ‚Äúthe seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.‚Äù So, why do so many rest and worship on a different day of the week? When is the Sabbath? Saturday or Sunday? Could it be that the Christian Church has allowed man‚Äôs tradition to overshadow God‚Äôs way? Finally, why does it matter which day is the true day of worship and which is the counterfeit sabbath?

The ‚Äúfirst day,‚Äù or Sunday, is only mentioned eight times in the New Testament. Some of these verses describe how women returned to Jesus‚Äô tomb on Sunday to finish preparing the body of Christ (Mark 16:1-2, Mark 16:9, Matthew 28:1, Luke 24:1, John 20:1). Jesus was crucified on Friday, called the ‚Äúpreparation day,‚Äù because they were to prepare for God‚Äôs holy Sabbath day, Saturday. Jesus then rested in the tomb on Sabbath, the ‚Äúseventh day‚Äù of the week, and rose on Sunday, the ‚Äúfirst day‚Äù of the week. 

If we look at other verses mentioning the ‚Äúfirst day‚Äù in the New Testament, we see no hint of change.

Many Christians read in Luke 4:16 that Jesus, ‚Äúas His custom was,‚Äù went to church on the Sabbath. Christ said in Matthew 24:20 that His disciples would be keeping the seventh-day Sabbath 40 years after the cross. So, Jesus didn‚Äôt change the Sabbath! The Bible promises in Hebrews 13:8, ‚ÄúJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.‚Äù 

God did not change the Sabbath, Jesus would not change the Sabbath, and the disciples could not change the Sabbath! (Acts 5:29) 

We can look to Bible prophecy to see how God‚Äôs Sabbath could have been changed to a counterfeit. In Daniel 7:2-3, Daniel saw four great beasts come up from the sea. Daniel describes the beasts as a lion, a bear, a leopard, and a beast with ten horns. Verse 17 states that the beasts represent four kings, or kingdoms.

Most Bible scholars agree that the fourth beast represents the Roman Empire. Daniel 7:8 says ‚ÄúI was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them . . . ‚Äù This little horn comes up among the first ten horns, after the fall of Rome.

Daniel 7:25 predicts, ‚ÄúHe [the little horn] shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall persecute the saints of the Most High, and shall intend to change times and laws . . .‚Äù

The Bible tells us that Sunday‚Äôs sacredness comes from the tradition of men, changed from the law of God. It is Jesus Himself in Matthew 15:3-9 who says ‚Äúin vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.‚Äù

God says the Sabbath is a great sign. (Ezekiel 20:12; Exodus 31:16) It‚Äôs a sign of our loyalty to Christ. It is a sign that we can rest in the completed work of salvation through Christ. The Bible Sabbath matters so much to God that He wrote it in stone!

Are you willing to follow wherever Jesus leads? The road may be narrow, but the way of Jesus leads to the tree of life in the city of God.

   <media:description>This masterclass will cover The Sabbath Day as found in the fourth commandment. It will trace it‚Äôs history all the way from creation and then through the history of Israel into New Testament times. It will also look at the benefits for Christians today.

The world has increasingly forgotten about God and His ways. How is that possible? The answer is found in a day, which is The Authentic Seal. #theSabbathDay

THE AUTHENTIC SEAL
Have you ever wondered why people would put a seal on a letter or document? What does it stand for?

A seal bears the name, title and territory of its owner and conveys authority and ownership to the receiver of the message. In ancient times, wax seals were often used on contracts or treaties as an identifying mark of authority and authenticity. Did you know God uses a ‚Äòseal‚Äô to identify his followers and mark them for redemption? Surely, humans won‚Äôt receive a wax seal on their foreheads‚Äîso what is this seal?

The Sabbath is a seal of commitment and relationship. By observing the Sabbath, God‚Äôs followers show they belong to Him. So, how do you observe the Sabbath and when is it?

Humans are the only created beings that can discern right from wrong and the part of our brain that makes those choices is our prefrontal cortex which sits behind our foreheads. When we choose to ‚Äúremember the Sabbath day‚Äù as it states in the fourth of ten commandments, we are choosing to be ‚Äòsealed‚Äô by God. The Sabbath exists to remind us who God is. He is Creator of Heaven and Earth.  

God said through the prophet Ezekiel ‚ÄúI gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the Lord made them holy‚Äù (Ezekiel 20:12). God wants us to remember that He is our Creator and Redeemer. 

God created humans on the sixth day of creation‚ÄìFriday. The very next day‚ÄìSabbath; He rested, blessed it and made it holy. God wants to spend valuable time with the creation He made in His image. This means He wants to spend time with you.

Did you know the Sabbath has existed since the very first week of creation and it was not intended for only a select group of people? God created the Sabbath with the intention of spending time with all people. The Sabbath existed long before God gave the commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai; Paul and the Christian Gentiles were still keeping the Sabbath holy long after Jesus died on the cross.

When God created the days of the week, each 24-hour period was marked by the rotation of the earth. The night portion preceded the day portion, which means that sunset is the first part of a new day. Each day of the week begins with the evening portion at sunset. So it makes sense that the Sabbath would begin Friday evening at sunset and continue until Saturday evening at sunset.

What more can God do to emphasize the permanence and importance of His holy Sabbath day? He spoke it with His voice, wrote it with His finger, and sent His own beloved Son Jesus as our example to live by. The disciples taught it and God‚Äôs believers will keep it on the New Earth throughout all of eternity.

When the Creator of the universe asks you to do something, it makes sense to follow His direction. Don‚Äôt you think? Especially when His motive for spending time with us is love.</media:description>

   <media:description>Would applying the Ten Commandments given to Moses change society? What has happened to the values of yesteryear? How has our society become so self-centered, disrespectful, and entitled? Is there a better way?  Is it possible that we‚Äôve forgotten our most foundational values? 

There is a different path, The Way reveals that journey. This masterclass will explore the Ten Commandments and what they mean, how they apply and do they have any significance in the life of a Christian.

THE WAY

While in today‚Äôs world, everyone seems to have a different definition of what is right and wrong, God has outlined a clear standard for morality. In Exodus chapter 20 God has given us the Ten Commandments to show us the way to love and freedom. The first four commandments show us how to have a relationship with God, while the last six commandments deal with our relationship with each other.

In the first four commandments, we find that God desires us to acknowledge Him as our Creator and to give Him first place in our lives (Commandment #1). He desires us to worship Him ‚Äúin spirit and in truth‚Äù (John 4:24) rather than through man-made idols (Commandment #2). God asks us to respect His name as a sign of our loyalty to Him (Commandment #3). Furthermore, God asks us to keep His Sabbath day holy and spend a 24-hour period in worship and thanksgiving with Him (Commandment #4).

The last six commandments admonish us to honor our parents (Commandment #5); leave off acts of harm such as hate, anger, revenge and murder (Commandment #6); stay true to our marriage vows (Commandment #7); not take anything that is not rightfully ours (Commandment #8); not involve ourselves in lying or gossiping (Commandment #9); and calls us to be content with what we have trusting that God will provide everything that we need (Commandment #10).

God‚Äôs law is like a wall of protection, prohibiting us from falling into one of the many landmines of sin. It is God‚Äôs desire for man and woman to be happy and live in peace. Obeying God‚Äôs rules will save us from learning things the hard way, but by themselves they won‚Äôt give us a personal experience with God. In fact, a list of rules without having an actual experience with God can be a miserable experience. 
The reason we obey is not because we are trying to earn God‚Äôs favor. It‚Äôs the response of our love for Him. Will you choose to follow His way today?

   <media:description>This will be a masterclass on Revelation 14. We have seen polarizing politics, increased hate crimes, hunger for power, and the oppression of the poor. Is there a lasting solution to all of these problems? The Warning provides a framework for understanding that there is a day of reckoning and how you can be safe.

The book of Revelation presents the Gospel message being the good news of Jesus' saving grace. That good news also comes in the form of a somber warning that there is an end coming where the world will be judged. God calls for each of us to be ready.

THE WARNING

Do you seek relief from the things that you‚Äôve done wrong?  Are you searching for peace in place of anxiety and fear?  You‚Äôre not alone.  In this look at what God says about the end of time, you‚Äôll leave your fears behind and find new hope in God‚Äôs love for you!

God has often sent warnings before disasters strike.  Inspired by God, Noah warned of a worldwide flood that destroyed the earth just as Joseph forewarned Pharaoh of a devastating famine.  And God has sent another warning to you and me to prepare for the end of time.  

In Revelation 14:6-9, we find this final message of warning.  The good news is that it is wrapped in God‚Äôs love for us.  It is known as the ‚Äúeverlasting gospel.‚Äù  A message reminding us that God willingly let His only son be put to death to pay for our sins.  

How encouraging!  Though we must face God‚Äôs judgement, He has provided a way to ensure our forgiveness through Jesus!  And this forgiveness also opens the door for eternal life with Him in heaven!

The first angel gives the warning to ‚Äúfear God‚Äù and to ‚Äúgive glory to Him.‚Äù  These instructions show our need to obey God‚Äôs law and to follow His teachings for how to live our lives.  (See Ecclesiastes 12:13 and 1 Corinthians 10:31)  

Next, the angel turns to the issue of worship.  You see, we live in an age where millions reject God as our Creator.  In this message of warning, God is calling the world to worship him as our Creator God.  

Why is this message so important?  The angel says that ‚Äúthe hour of His judgement is come.‚Äù  This indicates that God is doing the judging now.  A time of investigation is taking place before Jesus comes so that He will know who gets the reward of eternal life.  (See Revelation 22:12)

Could it be that we are living in this time of judgement?  Is our future being decided by the choices we make today?  This can be scary to think about, right?  

The good news is that God has warned us ahead of time.  We don‚Äôt need to be afraid.  He wants us to be ready and has opened the way for us to have everlasting life!

The second and third angels focus on truth and error.  Many people are being misled by following the false teachings of men rather than listening to God‚Äôs Word.  The warnings of these two angels are some of the most serious in all of the Bible.  

Don‚Äôt worry.  In upcoming videos, we will look into the meaning of Babylon and the Mark of the Beast.  Just remember that God‚Äôs Word is our source of safety and of truth!  (See John 17:17)

The key takeaway from this final warning is that you can be prepared to stand before God in this judgement.  Through the messages of the three angels, God has provided a way for the world to be ready when He returns to earth.  

God is preparing a group of people who will worship Him as Creator.  They will obey Him because they love Him.  And this group of individuals will stand up for Jesus no matter what happens.  

Have you come to a place where you want to give your life to God?  Do you want forgiveness, peace, and the assurance of God‚Äôs love?  Take this moment and give Him your heart!
