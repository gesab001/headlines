    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[VENTURA, CA - JUNE 24: The bronze statue of Father Junipero Serra who founded nine Spanish missions in California including Mission San Buenaventura stands in front of Ventura City Hall. A joint statement was issued from local political, indigenous and Catholic leaders pledging to remove the monument, originally commissioned in the 1930s but replaced in 1989. "The time has come for the statue to be taken down and moved to a more appropriate nonpublic location," read the statement, issued by Ventura Mayor Matt LaVere. After a protest last weekend Ventura city spokeswoman Heather Sumagaysay said the city is making plans to host community discussions regarding the Serra statue and there is no timeline for its removal, she said. "It is our priority to be receptive to public concerns and provide an environment where all voices are heard and respected. A historic decision such as this will involve the voices of the Chumash tribe, the City Council and the residents of Ventura," Sumagaysay said in an emailed statement. "The city remains committed to collaborating with the community to determine next steps. We will inform the public of opportunities to participate and offer input at a future meeting." The move comes after a Father Serra statue was toppled last weekend on Olvera St. in downtown Los Angeles and people were considering changing the name of Ft Bragg, but voted the change down.

Los Angeles campuses will not reopen for classes on Aug. 18, and the nation's second-largest school system will continue with online learning until further notice, because of the worsening coronavirus surge, Supt.

But, he said, "We're going in the wrong direction. And as much as we want to be back at schools and have students back at schools - can't do it until it's safe and appropriate."
