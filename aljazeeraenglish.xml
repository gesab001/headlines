   <media:description>Health workers in Ecuador have apologised for telling a woman her sister had died of the coronavirus, only to find out she was alive and recovering in a hospital.
Ecuador's number of confirmed cases has almost doubled over just two days. And the strain on the health system has begun to show in disturbing ways.

   <media:description>The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is calling for an end to violence after southern separatists in the city of Aden declared self-rule.
The Southern Transitional Council which the UAE backs is seeking a return to independence and is accusing the government of mismanagement.
But Saudi Arabia is calling for all sides to abide by a power-sharing agreement signed five months ago.

   <media:description>Rumours have swirled surrounding the health of North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's health following his noticeable absence from state media, official statements and public events in recent days. 
The third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father's death in 2011 has no clear successor and it is unclear who would lead the nuclear-armed nation in the event of his incapacitation.
Jim Walsh is a senior research associate in the Security Studies Program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He joins us on Skype from Boston.

   <media:description>Yemen's complex civil war has been going on for six years.
It's aggravated decades-long divisions between north and south.
They joined to form one country in 1990, but it's been an uneasy unity.
Secessionists in the south now say they're going to govern alone.
The Southern Transitional Council - backed by the United Arab Emirates - declared self rule, accusing President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi of mismanagement.
Hadi's government condemned the declaration as catastrophic and dangerous.
How will this complicate efforts to end the war?

Presenter: Bernard Smith

Guests:
AlKhadher Sulaiman - Director of Office of Foreign Affairs, the Southern Transitional Council in New York
Elisabeth Kendall - Senior Research Fellow, Pembroke College, University of Oxford

   <media:description>Ramadan is underway and more than 1.8 billion Muslims are observing the holy month, but in very different ways than they’ve been used to. 

As countries around the world fight to flatten the curve, mosques are shuttered and there are bans on mass gatherings for prayers to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

Imams, scholars and the World Health Organization have called for daily prayers to be performed at home, fasts to be broken without extended family or friends, and charity to be given in the form of monetary donations to organisations rather than meals. 

The Muslim Council of Britain has published a list of guidelines for this year’s #RamadanAtHome. In addition to virtual prayers and gatherings, they suggest meal planning to limit trips outside the home and paying special attention to mental health.

 Not all Muslims will mark the month under lockdown, though. Pakistan will allow congregational prayersat mosques during Ramadan, but worshippers must keep a distance of two metres from each other, and will be encouraged to bring their own prayer mats. 

While many Muslims are worried about the impact of the pandemic on the holy month, others say turning a month of socialising into a month of separation is not a bad thing. It will allow for focused reflection and prayer, getting to the root of what the fast is supposed to be about.

On the next episode of Stream we’ll meet members of the Muslim community and ask what Ramadan means in a pandemic, a historic first.

   <media:description>Ziyanda Ngcobo is a young, ambitious journalist known for reporting on the scourge of political violence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

The province has seen more than 500 political assassinations since the country's first democractic elections in 1994, as politicians fall prey to a deadly scramble for state resources and contracts.

Ziyanda is now investigating the murder of Sindiso Magaqa, a popular local politician and member of the ruling ANC party known for his anti-corruption work. He was fatally shot in July 2017.

As the murder trial plays out across the nation's TV screens, Ziyanda revisits the scene of the crime looking for answers. She also speaks to a politician who has become a whistle-blower against corruption and is a key witness to the murder.

Her investigation takes her to the Glebelands hostel complex, where the murder rate is four times the national average and a high unemployment rate means residents are more vulnerable to being hired as hitmen.

Many of those who witnessed these killings, or whose loved ones were lost, face threats of their own and still live in fear.

Ziyanda is determined to continue reporting despite the dangers, working all hours of the day to get the story out.

South Africa's Deadly Politics follows Ziyanda as she pushes issues of political violence into the national spotlight, determined to expose what she sees as an absolute threat to post-apartheid South Africa and its democracy.

   <media:description>Lockdown has changed everything - millions have been confined to their homes, public spaces have been left deserted. While journalists, like everyone else, have struggled to adapt to new and unprecedented working conditions, photojournalists have found opportunity amid the adversity. 

&quot;During the first two weeks, no journalists were allowed in the area where I live so they couldn't show the world what was going on here,&quot; says Marzio Toniolo, a 35-year old teacher turned photographer. &quot;That's when I saw an opportunity.&quot;

Toniolo lives in San Fiorano, northern Italy, the epicentre of Europe's coronavirus outbreak and one of the worst affected regions in the world. His photographs document how his family, three generations under one roof, have adapted to a strict lockdown well into its third month.

&quot;I wanted to focus on the normality of it all - what was going on at home day in, day out… I think everyone can identify in some way with my family's situation.&quot;

On the other end of the spectrum, the great urban spaces where millions once gathered, now lie empty and desolate. Phil Penman is a British photographer based in New York City, and in 25 years of chronicling life in the city, he's never seen anything like it.

&quot;It's very weird because you go out there and there are no photographers. So I wanted to try to capture the emptiness of the city.&quot;

His work is achingly quiet. Landmarks such as Grand Central Terminal and the Statue of Liberty - once teeming with visitors - are shrouded in silence and stillness.

&quot;It's just totally bizarre,&quot; says Penman. &quot;If I was the city, I would be asking what happened? You know, where is everybody? It's emotional being out there.&quot; 

In other parts of the world, solitude is a luxury that many cannot afford.

&quot;Daily wage earners and workers live in highly crowded dwellings with barely any space to stretch their legs,&quot; explains Ravi Choudhary. &quot;If one of them catches coronavirus, it's inevitable others will get infected too because they cannot quarantine themselves.&quot;

Choudhary is a Delhi-based photographer for the Press Trust of India. His photographs provide shocking witness to the mass upheaval of migrant workers caused by the lockdown. Forced into the streets and stranded hundreds of kilometres from their homes, they have no choice but to attempt the journey on foot.

&quot;I followed this little girl with a large bag on her head after spotting her in the crowd and I asked her where she was headed,&quot; recalls Choudhary. &quot;Her village was about 400 kilometers away and I thought to myself, how is this little girl, with such a heavy burden, going to make it all the way back to her village… Sometimes all you need is one single photo to understand the whole story. &quot;

The Listening Post's Flo Phillips talks to three photographers - each with a unique perspective on life under lockdown, and how it has changed the way we inhabit the spaces in which we live.

   <media:description>Much like our daily routines, religious and cultural rituals have been derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.
A global ban on gatherings has meant that holidays like Passover, Easter and Vaisakhi are being celebrated in isolation. The same is happening for Muslims observing Ramadan and Eid.
Even those who aren’t religious are having to adapt - birthdays, weddings, even the way we mourn the dead.
Start Here explains how centuries of religious and cultural practices have changed.

   <media:description>Southern separatists in the port city of Aden have declared a state of emergency and autonomous rule over the region, accusing the internationally recognized government of mismanagement that has made the humanitarian situation there progressively worse.
The southern forces, backed by the United Arab Emirates, were allied with the government in Sanaa but turned away from that and seized Aden last year.

   <media:description>Watching TV is a popular pastime during the holy month of Ramadan, and Iraq is no exception.
It is perhaps the only custom that has remained unaffected by the curfew imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And that has raised the stakes for those producing the shows.
