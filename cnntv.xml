   <media:description>Thirteen Chicago police officers lounged and slept in the congressional campaign office of US Rep. Bobby Rush on June 1 as protests and looting occurred throughout the city, Rush and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said.
The officers, who included three supervisors, were seen on video lounging in Rush's office, sleeping, eating the congressman's popcorn and talking on the phone, Rush and Lightfoot said.
The incident came to light after Rush reviewed security camera footage from his office, the mayor explained at a news conference. The campaign office was broken into on Sunday, May 31, when the surrounding strip mall was looted, Lightfoot told CNN. She said the police officers entered the campaign office early Monday, June 1.

   <media:description>A Senate plan to remove names of Confederate leaders on military assets has sharply divided Republicans -- and has now put a GOP-led panel at odds with the White House at a time of a wide-ranging re-examination of race in the United States.
The amendment, offered by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, calls for the removal of names of Confederate leaders from all military assets -- whether it's a base, installation, facility, aircraft, ship, plane or type of equipment -- within three years. The plan was adopted behind closed doors by voice vote with the support of some Republicans, even as President Donald Trump condemned any action to remove Confederate leaders' names from military bases -- and the White House vowed to veto any such legislative effort.
&quot;There is always a history that we don't want to forget,&quot; Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said when asked about the plan, which he supports. &quot;With regard to that I agree with the President that we don't want to forget our history. ... But at the same time that doesn't mean that we should continue with those bases with the names of individuals who fought against our country.&quot;
The amendment comes at a precarious time for Trump, who has struggled to win support within the black community and has seen his poll numbers drop sharply amid his handling of both the coronavirus pandemic and the deep racial unrest caused by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed while in Minneapolis police custody.

   <media:description>Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, a Democrat, fired back at President Donald Trump in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo after Trump appeared to suggest he would intervene in the city's growing protests and called for law and order.
Trump also claimed that the protesters, who he called &quot;domestic terrorists,&quot; have taken over Seattle.
The President has threatened to use active military to tamp down protests and has encouraged governors to deploy the National Guard to help assist with demonstrations.

   <media:description>President Donald Trump warned against labeling &quot;tens of millions of decent Americans as racist or bigots&quot; during an event promoted as discussing &quot;justice disparities&quot; in Dallas. The roundtable did include faith leaders, law enforcement representatives, small business owners and senior members of the Trump administration, but the administration did not invite Dallas Police Chief Reneé Hall, Dallas County Sheriff Marian Brown and Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who are all black.

   <media:description>President Donald Trump will host his first rally in months next week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and he has plans to visit four other states in the coming weeks as his campaign prepares to relaunch in-person rallies.
The decision to hold a rally in Tulsa, a city with a checkered racial history, on June 19, or Juneteenth -- the day that marks the end of slavery in the United States -- is especially striking as the nation undergoes a conversation about racism in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police officers.

   <media:description>America's top general has apologized for appearing in a photo-op with President Donald Trump following the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House last week, calling the move a &quot;mistake&quot; and saying his presence &quot;created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.&quot;
Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a pre-recorded speech released that he regrets accompanying Trump on a walk from the White House to St. John's Church last week where he was photographed wearing his combat uniform and moving with the President's entourage through Lafayette Square.
The images provoked a swift wave of criticism from lawmakers and several senior former military officials who said they risked dragging the traditionally apolitical military into a contentious domestic political situation.
Milley also said that he was &quot;outraged&quot; by the killing of George Floyd and added that the protests it sparked spoke to &quot;centuries of injustice toward African Americans.&quot;

   <media:description>In the wake of George Floyd’s death, there is a call across the country to “Defund the Police.” Chris Cillizza explains why the slogan could be dangerous for Democrats and detract from the calls for reforming police departments, demilitarization and re-allocation of resources for community building.
