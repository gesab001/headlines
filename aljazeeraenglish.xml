   <media:description>Israel's troubled coalition government has not been sworn in yet, but it is already facing a major legal hurdle.
A petition to the High Court argues the power-sharing deal between Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and Benny Gantz's Blue and White party is illegal.
Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett reports from West Jerusalem.

   <media:description>The spread of the coronavirus and how to stop it dominates the news agenda of nearly every media outlet in the world right now.
Public health bodies rely on them to keep people informed.
But journalists are facing threats as they try to separate fact from misinformation.
There have been reports of retaliation against the media since the global outbreak began. 
Rights groups accuse some governments of using the pandemic as an excuse to censor the news and punish reporters.
So what are the challenges facing journalists?

   <media:description>As cases of coronavirus infection continue to mount across Bangladesh, the government is trying to limit the spread of the virus through a national lockdown while also preventing the country’s export-dependent economy from going into freefall.

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh are approaching 10,000, with scores of people dying from the disease, but the true number of cases is thought to be considerably higher due to a lack of testing. The country’s 161 million-strong population has been ordered to stay off the streets until at least May 16. Families across the country, many of whom rely on the wages of sole earners who can no longer work, are now hoping they will eventually receive some direct government assistance.

Yet the machines at Bangladesh’s garment factories have started to turn again. On Monday thousands of workers returned to the production line after the government permitted textile factories that generate 80 percent of the country’s exports to restart. Business leaders have welcomed the decision, but labour rights activists want greater protections for employees who now face working together at close quarters during a time of unprecedented risk to their health. 

Health professionals are concerned that Bangladesh could soon see a spike in infections that undermines the purpose of the lockdown. Virologists have noted a lack of testing that would give a clearer picture of the true number of coronavirus infections. Challenges to the country’s already-overburdened healthcare system are being exacerbated by a string of COVID-19 cases among doctors.

The Stream will look at what lies ahead for Bangladesh as it walks a fine line between propping up the economy and protecting public health.

A recent Amnesty International report says harassment and intimidation of journalists are so deeply entrenched, it makes Somalia one of the most dangerous places to report from.

   <media:description>When Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro was asked this week to respond to the fact his country had hit a record number of COVID-19 deaths in 24 hours, his response took even some supporters by surprise. &quot;So what?&quot; he replied, unleashing a deluge of criticism.

Latin America’s largest country faces a growing health emergency as it contends with the twin challenges of coronavirus and political turmoil.

More than 90,000 people in Brazil are confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, but health authorities estimate the actual number to be at least 10 times higher. 

Though millions are now at risk, Bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the seriousness of the situation, referring to the pandemic as a “measly cold.”

But as hospitals become overwhelmed with patients and mass graves proliferate, Bolsonaro is rapidly losing political clout. And the high-profile departures of his popular health and justice ministers in recent weeks have left him vulnerable to impeachment inquiries.

In the absence of federal leadership, local governors have attempted to enforce social distancing measures. But in poorer neighborhoods, this has been impossible.

In this episode we ask, does Brazil's Bolsonaro care about coronavirus?

   <media:description>The coronavirus pandemic has caused tens of thousands of Afghans to cross the border from Iran, the region's worst hit country.
But some have also been trying to go in the other direction, looking for work. 
Now, Afghanistan is accusing Iranian border forces of drowning dozens of Afghan migrants, to stop them from crossing over. 
It is thought at least 38 people died. Iran has denied the allegations.

   <media:description>Police in Malaysia have detained more than 700 refugees and migrant workers. 
They live in areas where COVID-19 cases surged last month, triggering accusations that foreigners are spreading the virus. 
Rights groups say they could be held for months in dangerously cramped conditions, and that detaining the migrants in close quarters will only increase the virus. 
Phil Robertson is the Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch.
He says Malaysian authorities are risking the health of the people they have arrested.

   <media:description>As government lockdowns focus on limiting the spread of the coronavirus, scientists around the world are working on treating and protecting us.
They have their work cut out. Vaccine and drug development is laborious, full of experimentation and repeated testing. Knowing how the virus works is key.  
But what other challenges do they face? And how long will it take before we can defeat this virus with a pill or an injection?

   <media:description>Nearly eight million people in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, are marking the fasting month of Ramadan under a lockdown imposed to try and curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.  
But with the country facing an economic crisis as well, stocking up for the month has been hard for many - especially for families who rely on a day-to-day income.

   <media:description>Tens of millions of people in China were confined to their homes during its strict coronavirus lockdown.
Now, although restrictions have been eased, many are afraid of venturing outside even for basic supplies. 
But thanks to China's vast home delivery network, drivers and logistics companies are helping the economy tick over while people stay indoors.

   <media:description>Much of the coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic treats the World Health Organization (WHO) as an authoritative, impartial source of information. But should it?

From the advent of COVID-19, the WHO's press conferences have been a fixture in global news coverage. They serve as a touchstone for journalists and, given that the WHO has 194 member states, the pressers have become a primary source of information for global context.

&quot;The WHO does shape information globally quite significantly,&quot; says Lawrence Gostin, a professor in global health law at Georgetown University who has worked closely with the WHO in the past, &quot;because it is a trusted and objective science adviser to the world&quot;.

However, the organisation's objectivity has been called into question. It started in early January when China media analysts started observing a similarity between what the WHO was saying and official statements coming out of China. For example, on January 14, the WHO tweeted: &quot;Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus&quot;.

That same day, the Wuhan Health Commission's public bulletin declared, &quot;We have not found proof for human-to-human transmission.&quot; The question is, why would the WHO repeat - almost verbatim - the claims made by China when news outlets, in Hong Kong and elsewhere, were already comparing the novel coronavirus to SARS and saying that it could very well be transferred from person to person? The answer comes down to access. China only granted the WHO access to Wuhan in February 2020, nearly three months after the first case was detected.

&quot;WHO's reporting, by virtue of its governance, is highly dependent on every member country's ability, honesty and willingness to share data and issue notifications of epidemics,&quot; says Osman Dar, director of the Global Health Programme at Chatham House. &quot;Its verification systems can only be as good as the access their member states provide.&quot;

Which is the crux of the issue. Member states are not beholden to the WHO but rather the WHO is beholden to them. Not only is the organisation's access, in large part, determined by its member states, but they also make up most of the WHO's funding.

On April 15, US President Donald Trump threatened to halt his country's funding to the WHO, accusing the organisation of being China-centric. The president's critics say the threat was an attempt to deflect criticism of Trump's own mishandling of this crisis; however, his actions highlight a key vulnerability in the WHO.

The US is, by far, the organisation's biggest funder and if Washington follows through with Trump's threat, then that would severely hinder its operational capacity. Which begs the question - how can the WHO speak truth to power when those powers largely control its access and its funding?

&quot;It's not totally neutral. If you're seeing something coming from the WHO, it's something that its member states wanted to be released, it is something that a member state consented to be released,&quot; says Stephen Buranyi, a journalist at The Guardian newspaper, &quot;to see the full picture, you have to go beyond what states are telling it.&quot;

   <media:description>One of the most well-known figures of Indigenous Berber music has died.
Born Hamid Cheriet in 1949 in Ath Yenni, a Berber-speaking region in the central Atlas Mountains of Algeria, his musical prowess began to be recognised by his colleagues in a gas and oil field where he worked.
The Algerian musician, known by his stage name Idir, used his songs to address social and political injustices. He was 70 years old when he died.
 
Al Jazeera’s Laura Burdon-Manley takes a look at his life and career.

   <media:description>India has dropped two places on the World Press Freedom Index, now ranking at 142 out of 180 countries.
Reporters Without Borders says a communications blackout in Indian-administered Kashmir, which made it increasingly difficult for journalists to report on what is happening in the region, played a significant role in that shift.
Their report calls the area a &quot;vast open prison&quot;.
Yet, India's government maintains there is nothing short of absolute media freedom.

   <media:description>While some individual states have already filed suits against China, the administration of US President Donald Trump is reportedly considering measures against China for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump’s position is that China could have done more to warn and protect the world from the pandemic.
Such measures could worsen already strained relations between Washington and Beijing.

   <media:description>The global fall in oil prices has left many governments reeling, but Iran's president says his country's economy is able to cope better than most, thanks to being forced to diversify because of US sanctions.
When global oil prices fell earlier this month, some Iranians turned to social media and began asking for the savings to be passed on to them.
