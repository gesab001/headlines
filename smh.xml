The articles may have suggested Ms Cleggâs candidature was in the mind of her husband, energy minister Angus Taylor, when he wrote a letter to Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore relying on erroneous figures concerning travel expenses that were contained in a document. The Herald acknowledges it had no information to suggest that any document was forged by Minister Taylor or Ms Clegg. The Herald also acknowledges Ms Clegg has never intended to seek office for Lord Mayor of Sydney. The Herald apologises for any harm to Ms Cleggâs personal and professional reputation.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">p54tpr</guid><link>https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/apology-20200517-p54tpr.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:01:00 +1000</pubDate><title>Apology</title></item><item><dc:creator>Stephen Brook</dc:creator><description>The coronavirus outbreak has put intense strain on the media industry in ways that are now starting to surface in curious ways.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">p54trq</guid><link>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/pandemic-pressure-puts-nine-boss-in-spotlight-20200517-p54trq.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate><title>Pandemic pressure puts Nine boss in spotlight</title></item><item><dc:creator>Alex Druce</dc:creator><description>The Australian share market is expected to start the week in positive territory but coronavirus-sparked volatility is likely to reign supreme as the week progresses.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">p54tqw</guid><link>https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/asx-tipped-to-climb-as-investors-eye-fresh-set-of-economic-data-20200517-p54tqw.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate><title>ASX tipped to climb as investors eye fresh set of economic data</title></item><item><dc:creator>Patrick Hatch</dc:creator><description>Canadian asset manager BrookfieldÂ has threatened to walk away from the Virgin Australia sale process in frustration with how Deloitte is managing the process.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">p54tqe</guid><link>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/brookfield-threatens-to-walk-away-from-virgin-australia-in-frustration-20200517-p54tqe.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate><title>BrookfieldÂ threatens to walk away from Virgin Australia in frustration</title></item><item><dc:creator>Zoe Samios</dc:creator><description>New Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan says the negotiating table for the broadcasting rights is open to all interested parties.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">p54tqc</guid><link>https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/new-rugby-australia-chairman-confident-the-code-will-get-screen-time-20200517-p54tqc.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate><title>New Rugby Australia chairman confident the code will get screen time</title></item><item><dc:creator>Royce Millar</dc:creator><description>Storm surges since Easter have left coastal communities concerned for beaches and homes</description><guid isPermaLink="false">p54tpu</guid><link>https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/erosion-from-surging-seas-threaten-roads-homes-and-beaches-20200517-p54tpu.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate><title>Erosion from surging seas threaten roads, homes and beaches</title></item><item><dc:creator>Ross Gittins</dc:creator><description>With the lockdown slowly being unlocked a return to the &#39;lifter vs leaners&#39;
