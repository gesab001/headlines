   <media:description>When it comes to fighting coronavirus, social distancing and handwashing play a key role in limiting infection. But these precautions are not always an option for homeless people, making them all the more vulnerable to contracting the virus. Stay-at-home orders also impede access to soup kitchens, churches and other essential services that people without homes rely on. 

Advocates, therefore, argue that efforts to tackle the coronavirus in the US must include ways to address homelessness. But is there the political will to do this? In this episode of The Stream, we ask a panel of experts.

   <media:description>It's known as one of the pillars of global security after the end of the Cold War.
The Open Skies treaty allows the U.S., Russia, Canada and European countries to fly over each other's territories and monitor military activity.
But earlier this year, President Donald Trump announced Washington wants to withdraw from the pact.
U.S. officials say Russia is violating the agreement by blocking flights over military facilities, and using planes to map out American infrastructure for possible attack.The Kremlin rejects the allegations.
The world's largest military alliance NATO is urging Russia to comply with the agreement.
So, could the treaty collapse? And has it become outdated in today's world?

   <media:description>Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed’s work towards securing a peace deal with neighbouring Eritrea brought him to the attention of the world, and saw him awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. And he has won support at home for releasing political prisoners and trying to forge national unity. But just six months after Ethiopia’s first Oromo leader accepted the award in Oslo, the killing of a popular musician in Addis Ababa is fuelling a wave of both cross-communal and intra-ethnic unrest, amid unease over a postponed election.

Hachalu Hundessa, an Oromo protest singer, was shot dead in the Ethiopian capital on June 29. Police suspect a targeted killing. Thousands of people in the Oromia region took to the streets demanding answers, and scores of people were killed amid violence between gangs from different backgrounds. Jawar Mohammed and Bekele Gerba, two prominent Oromo opponents of Abiy, were arrested.

Politicians in opposition to Abiy’s Prosperity Party-led government were already critical of its declaration of a state of emergency in April due to the impact of coronavirus, as well as by parliament’s recent votes to delay elections due in August and allow Abiy to remain in office beyond his term. His opponents contend he is trying to hold on to power.

Abiy has long said that he wants to promote pan-Ethiopianism through his ‘medemer’ (‘coming together’) philosophy, and the recently-formed Prosperity Party brings together several parties representing Oromo, Afar and Amhara communities, among others. But the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which dominated a coalition government for years before Abiy took office, is absent. And historical differences over land and political power in Ethiopia persist.

With an election now on ice, Tigrayan leaders in the north vowing to forge ahead with their own vote, and support for Abiy’s government cooling in his Oromia heartland, does a crisis loom for Ethiopia and its prime minister?

   <media:description>The border between Australia's two most populous states is closing indefinitely as coronavirus infections soar on one side. 
Authorities in Victoria are scrambling to bring the spiking case numbers back down in the state, locking down residents and bringing in more social distancing measures. 
Australia has fared better than many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the outbreak is a clear example of how quickly the virus can return.

   <media:description>Some of the earliest statues of the Buddha are among precious items housed at the National Museum of Afghanistan.
But the US estimates that nearly 70 percent of the treasures have been looted from the museum or destroyed during four decades of war or under strict Taliban rule.
Now, historians at the University of Chicago and teachers in Afghanistan are working together to preserve what is left of this cultural heritage.

   <media:description>Libya's UN-recognised government has condemned air raids on a recaptured air base in the west of the country.
It says a “foreign air force” carried out the attack.
The loss of the facility in May was among a string of recent defeats for renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, pushing him out of large parts of western Libya.
Haftar launched an offensive to seize the capital, Tripoli, last year.

   <media:description>The survivor of a brutal honour killing in India testifies against her parents in the murder trial of her lower-caste husband.

In March 2016, Kausalya and her husband Shankar were brutally attacked on a crowded street in southern India.

Shankar, who came from a lower Dalit caste, died of his injuries. Kausalya survived and accused her parents of orchestrating an honour killing.

Witness follows Kausalya as she fights for justice through the courts, testifying against her parents in a trial where they face the death penalty.

Kausalya's now-estranged grandparents and brother, Gautham, also await the verdict, desperately hoping Kausalya's mother and father will be released.

The unique access to both sides shows a family torn apart by a caste hierarchy that remains deeply-rooted in India's social fabric.

   <media:description>The coronavirus crisis has disrupted global food supply chains, leading to shortages in some countries. 
The World Bank warns 130 million people could be at risk of starvation.
But an increasingly popular urban farming system could provide a solution.

   <media:description>COVID-19 cases and deaths are surging along Colombia's Caribbean coast as the region becomes the epicentre of the pandemic in the country, with doctors warning many deaths are going unreported.
Intensive care units are now 80 percent full in Bogota. 
The national government bought new ventilators to increase availability but a lack of trained doctors means not all of them can be used at the same time. 

Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti reports from Bogota.

   <media:description>Iran's now admitting a fire caused significant damage at its Natanz nuclear facility.
Its Atomic Energy Organization says the blaze could slow development of centrifuges used to enrich uranium. 
But Iran is planning to update the facility with more advanced equipment. 

Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi reports from Tehran.

   <media:description>Iran is expressing frustration at attempts to save the 2015 nuclear deal.
It's triggered a mechanism to resolve issues with Britain, France and Germany.
The Iranian foreign minister sent a letter to European leaders on Friday - accusing them of not living up to their side of the agreement.
Javad Zarif says Tehran has now triggered the dispute mechanism of the agreement six times.
The Europeans, Russia and China have been trying to salvage the deal after the U.S. pulled out in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.
Since then, Tehran has been rolling back its commitments.
But with the U.S. determined to keep isolating Iran, is the agreement still worth saving?
