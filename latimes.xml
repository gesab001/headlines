The sun sets on Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles, which has served as a hub of Latino life, commerce and culture for decades. The affordable shopping district and surrounding neighborhoods was fertile ground for an emerging, immigrant-rich middle class. Today, the heart of Whittier Blvd., from Atlantic Avenue on the west to Eastern Avenue on the east, is facing a new host of challenges from the coronavirus pandemic, economic meltdown and creeping gentrification. For many, this faded but resilient avenue remains a crossroads of change and hope. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

Lutfi's lawsuit had accused Britney's mom, Lynne Spears, of libel and her dad, Jamie Spears, of battery. It also accused her conservatorship of failing to pay him a 15% fee on the singer's income during the time he claimed to have been her manager.
