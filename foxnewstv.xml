Will we see a Trump rally this election cycle? President Trump had suspended his rallies in early March amid the coronavirus pandemic, but it looks like he is going to be hitting the campaign trail in the near future. Communications Director for the 2020 Trump re-election campaign Tim Murtaugh discusses when we should expect the president to hold his famous rallies. Murtaugh also weighs in on the calls across the U.S. to defund the police, and why the campaign doesn't put much stock in public polls.

What impact will the pandemic, an economic crisis and the push for police reform have on this year's congressional races? Fox News politics editor and co-host of the &quot;I'll Tell You What Podcast&quot;, Chris Stirewalt discusses the battle for the control of Congress and which contests we should keep an eye on.

Plus, commentary by Robert Jeffress, Fox News Contributor and pastor of the Dallas First Baptist Church.

The FOX News Rundown is a news-based daily morning podcast. Each morning, Jacqui Heinrich, Dave Anthony, Lisa Brady, Jessica Rosenthal and Chris Foster take a deep dive into the major and controversial stories of the day, tapping into the massive reporting resources of FOX News to provide a full picture of the news.

Each day The FOX News Rundown features insight from top newsmakers, along with FOX News reporters and contributors, plus a daily commentary on a significant issue of the day. Check us out each morning.
