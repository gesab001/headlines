    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[VENTURA, CA - JUNE 24: The bronze statue of Father Junipero Serra who founded nine Spanish missions in California including Mission San Buenaventura stands in front of Ventura City Hall. A joint statement was issued from local political, indigenous and Catholic leaders pledging to remove the monument, originally commissioned in the 1930s but replaced in 1989. "The time has come for the statue to be taken down and moved to a more appropriate nonpublic location," read the statement, issued by Ventura Mayor Matt LaVere. After a protest last weekend Ventura city spokeswoman Heather Sumagaysay said the city is making plans to host community discussions regarding the Serra statue and there is no timeline for its removal, she said. "It is our priority to be receptive to public concerns and provide an environment where all voices are heard and respected. A historic decision such as this will involve the voices of the Chumash tribe, the City Council and the residents of Ventura," Sumagaysay said in an emailed statement. "The city remains committed to collaborating with the community to determine next steps. We will inform the public of opportunities to participate and offer input at a future meeting." The move comes after a Father Serra statue was toppled last weekend on Olvera St. in downtown Los Angeles and people were considering changing the name of Ft Bragg, but voted the change down.

Los Angeles campuses will not reopen for classes on Aug. 18, and the nation's second-largest school system will continue with online learning until further notice, because of the worsening coronavirus surge, Supt. Austin Beutner announced Monday. "Let me be crystal clear," Beutner said in an interview with The Times. "We all know the best place for students to learn is in a school setting." But, he said, "We're going in the wrong direction. And as much as we want to be back at schools and have students back at schools - can't do it until it's safe and appropriate."

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[VENTURA, CA - JUNE 24: Erica Cohee from Thousand Oaks photographs the bronze statue of Father Junipero Serra who founded nine Spanish missions in California including Mission San Buenaventura as it stands in front of Ventura City Hall. A joint statement was issued from local political, indigenous and Catholic leaders pledging to remove the monument, originally commissioned in the 1930s but replaced in 1989. "The time has come for the statue to be taken down and moved to a more appropriate nonpublic location," read the statement, issued by Ventura Mayor Matt LaVere. After a protest last weekend Ventura city spokeswoman Heather Sumagaysay said the city is making plans to host community discussions regarding the Serra statue and there is no timeline for its removal, she said. "It is our priority to be receptive to public concerns and provide an environment where all voices are heard and respected. A historic decision such as this will involve the voices of the Chumash tribe, the City Council and the residents of Ventura," Sumagaysay said in an emailed statement. "The city remains committed to collaborating with the community to determine next steps. We will inform the public of opportunities to participate and offer input at a future meeting." The move comes after a Father Serra statue was toppled last weekend on Olvera St. in downtown Los Angeles and people were considering changing the name of Ft Bragg, but voted the change down.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[SYLMAR, CA - JULY 14, 2020 - - One of the 32 chimpanzees that still resides at the shuttered Wildlife Waystation on World Chimpanzee Day in the Angeles National Forest in Sylmar on July 14, 2020. The fate of the chimpanzees is uncertain because reputable sanctuaries willing to take them lack the funding needed to give the animals permanent new homes, officials say. The challenge now is finding the roughly $7 million it will take to build accommodations for the chimps at four reputable sanctuaries across the nation. A fundraiser was announced to help the sanctuaries take on these chimpanzees and to assist with the current care expenses of the primates while they wait at the Wildlife Waystation. More than 500 exotic animals including lions, tigers, alligators, wolves, owls and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs have been relocated since the troubled 44-year-old center surrendered its California Department of Fish and Wildlife permits and shut down a year ago.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - SEPTEMBER 28, 2018 - LAPD Chief Michel Moore talks to recruits during uniform inspection of this graduating class at the Los Angeles Police Department graduation exercises for Recruit Officer Class of April 16, 2018 happening at the LAPD Elysian Park Academy on September 28, 2018. Officer John Beaty talks about being an African American recruit and about why he joined the LAPD. In this class, three of the 34 graduates are African American (10 Caucasian, 21 Hispanic, no Asians). Much has been made of the LAPD's ethnic demographics roughly mirroring those of the city. But the impact of policing still falls disproportionately on black residents. The percentage of officers who are black - roughly 9% - will soon plummet. A huge number of black officers will soon retire and recent academy classes consistently have only a few black members. New Police Chief Michel Moore says black recruiting is one of his main priorities. But in the post-Ferguson era, theres a struggle to fight the forces discouraging young black people from becoming police officers. LAPD officers in the field today say they are facing unprecedented hostility from other black people, both in the field and at home, who view them as sellouts.
