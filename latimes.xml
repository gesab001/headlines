    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - JULY 27, 2020 - - Maria Reyes, second from left, spends time with her daughters Marilyn, 9, from left, Darlene, 4, Sophia, 6, and Leilani, 5, right, near their home in Los Angeles on July 27, 2020. All four of the children have attended Head Start, one of three major publicly-funded preschool programs serving low-income California families. California's youngest learners are returning to the classroom. But in the state's neediest zip code, 90011, in where the family lives, preschools remain closed. Such programs are considered essential to closing racial and economic achievement gaps among school-aged children - yet tens of thousands of eligible preschoolers can't get spots, including almost 2,000 Maria's zip code, the state's most underserved. As private preschools across California prepare to reopen, experts fear those in public programs will be left behind, and that thousands of existing spots could disappear.

Los Angeles campuses will not reopen for classes on Aug. 18, and the nation's second-largest school system will continue with online learning until further notice, because of the worsening coronavirus surge, Supt. Austin Beutner announced Monday. "Let me be crystal clear," Beutner said in an interview with The Times. "We all know the best place for students to learn is in a school setting." But, he said, "We're going in the wrong direction. And as much as we want to be back at schools and have students back at schools - can't do it until it's safe and appropriate."

County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

A Native American tribe has reclaimed a small part of ancestral lands on California's Big Sur coast that were lost to Spanish colonial settlement nearly 250 years ago. The Mercury News reports the Esselen Tribe of Monterey County closed escrow on 1,199 acres about 5 miles inland from the ocean that was part of a $4.5 million deal involving the state and the Western Rivers Conservancy. It marks the first restoration of any lands to the tribe. The land encompasses old-growth redwoods, oak woodlands, meadows and endangered steelhead trout.
