Millie is actively a lay leader and sits on several committees at the First United Methodist Church in Alhambra. Millie, who has lived in Alhambra her whole life within two blocks, has three children, one of whom died, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren. When asked what she attributed her long life to, Millie answered, "A hundred years ago the air was clean, the water was clean we had no problem and my mother was an excellent nutritionist, and we had home-grown chickens. And so we had so much chicken, I didn't cook it for ten years after I was married. Because that's' what we could raise. Just about two blocks from here. It was a small town. We knew everybody. Now that's all changed." Millie says she also credits her faith in God and support and help from friends and family. Millie was asked to offer her words of advice: "Well, it's easy to say, you have to live each day without the stress." (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
