During his visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden met with the family of Jacob Blake, the black man who was shot in the back by police. President Trump visited earlier in the week to signal his support for police, but did not meet Blake's family. Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley weighs in on the protests in Kenosha and across the country.

The film industry suffered a big blow when the coronavirus crisis hit and most theaters and production sets were forced to close. Nearly six months after the lockdowns began, many theaters are now open in some capacity and some major studio movies are beginning to be released. While things are getting better for Hollywood, they're not out of the woods yet. Michelle Pollino, an entertainment reporter for Fox News Radio and Fox News Headlines 24/7 on SiriusXM, discusses the theaters and studios trying to stay afloat and how the pandemic may have changed the way we see movies forever.

Plus, commentary by Fox Nation host Tammy Bruce.
