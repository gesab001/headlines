County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

During a typical 10-hour shift, she treats appendicitis, overdoses, skateboard accidents, arrhythmia, the usual off-the-street accidents, illnesses and conditions that flare up without notice. With more than 10 years at the hospital, she knows what to expect and how to treat it, but the coronavirus has changed that. She treats about 20 patients a day who arrive with coughs, fevers, shortness of breath and the fear and uncertainty that this pandemic has brought.UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica on Monday, April 6, 2020 in Santa Monica, CA.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA -- THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 2020: Kids do flips off the lifeguard tower while others relax on the sand on the last day of open beaches in Huntington Beach after Gov. Newsom announced the "hard close" of all Orange County state and local beaches Thursday, April 30, 2020. Newsom's retaliation came after thousands of Californians flocked to the shoreline there over the weekend in defiance of a statewide stay-at-home order enacted to stem the spread of the coronavirus. "When you contact the police chiefs to enforce your will as a leader-in my book you establish a police state" said Huntington Beach resident Pete Hamborg. "It's a moment that Gavin Newsom is taking away from us and are the very moments that empower us to deal with this crisis on a day-to-day basis." "I think the beach, which belongs to all Californians, is critical to our emotional health and well-being." (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

Gabriel is one of many indigenous people from Mexico and Guatemala who have lost employment due to the coronavirus. The Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations was given a $10,000 grant and an additional $5,000 donation to help indigenous people from Mexico and Guatemala, who are out of work in Los Angeles. Workers with the FIOB have been helping those who have lost their jobs by providing some funding and producing educational videos in indigenous languages.
