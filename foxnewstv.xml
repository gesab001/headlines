On the latest Hemmer Time podcast, Bill Hemmer is joined by Karl Rove, a Republican strategist and former Deputy Chief of Staff to George W. Bush. Karl explains the impact the pandemic is having on both parties and the upcoming conventions, how former Vice President Biden's sparse interactions with the press have both helped and hurt his campaign, and whether unemployment stimulus creates incentives for people to not work. Later, Karl Rove discusses the possibility of red states being flipped blue in the 2020 presidential election and political implications of the state of the economy.
