   <media:description>A Washington Post investigation shows Black people in the US are being shot and killed by police at more than twice the rate of white people.
George Floyd's death is just the latest incident this year. 
In March, Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by police as she lay in bed. 
Plain-clothes officers entered her Kentucky home in the middle of the night without warning. 
It was part of a drugs investigation - but nothing was found in the apartment. 
This month a Sudanese-American man, Yassin Mohamed, was shot dead in Georgia after several encounters with police. 
Advocates say he may have been suffering from mental health problems. 
Also in Georgia, police are accused of delaying the investigation into the February killing of jogger Ahmaud Arbery because one of the suspects has links to law enforcement.
Courtney Radsch, advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, discusses the issue with Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>When COVID-19 started to spread around the world, aid workers warned of disaster for Africa.
Health systems are weak and poorly funded in many places, and crowded cities making social distancing impossible.
But African countries appear to be managing.
Senegal and Ghana are among countries praised for their approach to tackle the disease.
The number of infections and deaths in Africa is much lower than the US, Europe, and Latin America.
But scientists say the figures are misleading because of low testing rates.
So are we getting a full picture of the situation?

   <media:description>India's government is being accused of using the coronavirus emergency to exploit millions of workers.
After two months of lockdown, some of India’s biggest states have suspended most labour laws in a bid to restart the economy.
Trade unions say changes to working hours, wages and health and safety standards weaken workers' rights at a time they cannot protest.

   <media:description>Ethnic minorities make up less than 20 percent of the British population but the outsized impact of coronavirus on their communities is startling. 
 
According to the UK’s Office for National Statistics black people are four times more likely to die from COVID-19 than white people. Ethnic Bangladeshi and Pakistani men are 1.8 times more likely to have a COVID-19-related death than white males. And ethnic minority women are 1.6 times more likely to die from the virus.
 
The impact on frontline workers is similarly stark. Almost 100 black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) medical staff are now known to have died from COVID-19. 
 
Under growing political pressure, the British government and National Health Service have launched a public health inquiry with initial findings due at the end of May. The opposition Labour party has begun an independent investigation of its own. 
 
Research available so far suggests several factors are driving the high infection rates and death toll in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups - bigger households, higher rates of comorbidities such as diabetes and heart disease, large numbers of BAME workers in frontline services and a lack of information in community languages.
 
Some scientists are examining whether a genetic component, alongside the other risk factors, may also predispose BAME populations to complications from COVID-19.
 
In this episode of The Stream, we look into the numbers and meet BAME community members to ask why the pandemic is having such a devastating impact on them.

   <media:description>In Libya, forces loyal to renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar have been forced to retreat as the UN-recognised government has been making rapid gains.
The two sides have been fighting for control of the west since April 2019.
Airpower has been a key factor in this conflict.
Al Jazeera's Alex Gatopoulos explains.

   <media:description>Donald Trump is often called the Tweeter in Chief.
Twitter is the U.S. president's main social media platform.
It's where he announces policies to more than 80 million followers, and where he's attacked opponents and spread misinformation.
Twitter is now in the president's firing line.
It placed a fact-check warning on two Trump tweets that falsely claimed postal ballots would lead to voter fraud.
The president accused the platform - in a tweet - of stifling free speech and silencing conservative voices.
But Twitter has been criticised for refusing to act on other Trump posts, such as those repeating a debunked claim that a TV host and former congressman was involved in the death of an intern.
With the U.S. election just six months away, can social media companies balance freedom of speech while rooting out misinformation?

Presenter: Bernard Smith

Guests:
Adolfo Franco - Republican strategist and former adviser to Senator John McCain
Derrick Plummer - Democratic strategist and former regional press secretary for the Democratic National Committee
Jim Anderson - Chief Executive of Social Flow, a technology firm dealing with social media content for companies

   <media:description>Social distancing and good hygiene are essential weapons in the fight against COVID-19.

But how can you maintain social distancing in one of the world's largest slums? How can you wash your hands regularly when there is no running water? And what happens when millions of people who survive on meagre wages are suddenly without work and struggling to feed themselves?

In India, 1.3 billion people were confined to their homes with just four hours' notice as the country embarked on the world's biggest lockdown.

Tens of millions of migrant workers suddenly found themselves jobless, quickly running out of money and food, and unable to return to their villages across India.

Ibrahim Mohammed worked as a rickshaw puller in New Delhi, but now he cannot leave the slum where he lives with his wife and four children.

&quot;Ever since the lockdown was announced, we are dying of hunger,&quot; he says. &quot;Now they say there is a sickness in the air. We may get sick, but before that, we will die of hunger.&quot;

Construction worker, Bhikhari Yadav, says he can no longer send money home to his wife and children in the eastern state of Bihar. He says migrant workers feel abandoned.

&quot;We have made this country the way it is,&quot; he says. &quot;But right now, the poor man is being kicked in the stomach.&quot;

101 East investigates India under lockdown.

   <media:description>The US secretary of state has told Congress Hong Kong's special status with the United States should end, as it is no longer an autonomous territory.
It comes as China prepares to impose new security laws on Hong Kong, which has sparked protests.
