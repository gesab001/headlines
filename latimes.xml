None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

The gas station is one of the few businesses that is still open during the day in Mariposa. Most of the storefronts have been closed since Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in mid-March that all Californians were being required to shelter in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Mariposa County is one of five California counties that as of April 28 only had one reported coronavirus case, despite the fact all the surroundings have. A 23-year-old woman in Marioposa County had tested positive for COVID-190. More than 47,000 Californians have tested positive for the novel coronavirus but in Mariposa County, Tuesday's result was the first. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

The students shop for homebound people, who are not just seniors, but anyone who needs help. The work is completely voluntary and the students are not paid. Six Feet Supplies, which takes its name from the separation required by social distancing, has more than 100 volunteers delivering food to a dozen homes a day, serving the homeless and manning a telephone help line for people who just need to talk.
