   <media:description>Polish voters have re-elected President Andrzej Duda to another term in office and the state broadcaster Telewijza Polska (TVP) was instrumental in his media campaign. To many Poles, TVP could just as well be Telewizja Propaganda - the channel backed Duda to the hilt, and helped him scrape through with a 51 percent victory.

Privately owned news outlets have been far more critical of Duda, so the president and his backers have tried to delegitimise those platforms over their foreign ownership. They have played the xenophobia card, suggesting that German investors in Polish media companies were trying to swing the election.

Now the Law and Justice party government is talking about the &quot;repolonisation&quot; of the country's privately-owned media - thinly disguised code for &quot;nationalisation&quot;.

On our radar

Richard Gizbert speaks to producer Flo Phillips about the crackdown on OMN, a major Ethiopian news network that has been covering mass protests against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government.

Ghassan Kanafani and the era of revolutionary Palestinian media

Some of the biggest names in the world of literature - Dickens, Hemingway, Garcia Marquez - got their start in journalism. Their reporting tends to be forgotten; their prose is what lives on.

Ghassan Kanafani is a name you can add to that list. Kanafani was a Palestinian writer who, through books like Men in the Sun, humanised the Palestinian condition, of dispossession and displacement. He was, however, first and foremost a journalist.

He was also a product of 1960s Beirut - a period when the city was a magnet for young reporters, revolutionaries, migrants and misfits, as well as host to the Palestinian leadership in exile. It was in Beirut that Kanafani produced Al Hadaf, a forward-thinking Palestinian magazine, that has been somewhat lost in the mists of time.

The Listening Post's Tariq Nafi reports from Beirut on the legacy of Ghassan Kanafani and the era of Palestinian revolutionary media.

   <media:description>The combative language between China and the United States has continued in recent days, as relations between the two superpowers deteriorate.
It has been a challenging few months for Beijing, where it has been criticised for a Hong Kong security law, and faced resistance on the use of Huawei’s technology.

   <media:description>The coronavirus crisis seems to be spinning out of control. On Thursday, the world recorded its worst single-day rise in infections - almost a quarter of a million in just 24 hours.
Cities that had declared a tentative victory - are falling back under lockdown, one by one.
The return of restrictions is an economic disaster for many nations already suffering from the first wave.
Governments say they're doing what they can, and some are bailing out flatlining industries.
Others have chosen to spend big - to create jobs, encourage spending and reduce individuals' debt.
And some have chosen welfare and public sector cuts too.
Now a group of millionaires is saying that cash - or at least part of it - should come from them.
The collective of 83 wealthy people around the globe has penned a letter calling themselves 'Millionaires for Humanity'.
The headline: Raise taxes on people like us. Immediately. Substantially. Permanently.
But will governments answer the millionnaires' call?
And how popular is this idea?

Presenter: Laura Kyle

Guests:
Morris Pearl, Chair of Patriotic Millionaires. A participant in ' Millionaires for Humanity' who has signed the petition.
Arun Advani, Assistant Professor of Economics and Impact Director of the CAGE Research Centre at University of Warwick.
Ana Caistor Arendar, Head of Inequality Campaign and Policy at Oxfam.

   <media:description>Voter suppression is a contentious issue in the United States, with an estimated six million convicted criminals unable to vote.
Some analysts say the system specifically targets African Americans, who are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system.
They are also four times more likely than any other racial group to be disenfranchised.

Six years ago, Catherine Corless, a local historian from County Galway in the Republic of Ireland, discovered that hundreds of babies and young children had died in a home for unmarried pregnant women, run by Roman Catholic nuns in her hometown of Tuam.

Further research revealed that many of the babies had died of malnutrition and other forms of neglect. Most of their bodies had been disposed of, officially unrecorded, in an old septic tank buried in the grounds of the home.

Angry survivors and relatives called for an investigation - for the remains to be exhumed, identified and properly buried, for compensation and immediate government action. Concerned families began to ask questions about other homes run by the Church in Ireland and how many other babies had died in equally mysterious circumstances.

In 2015, in response to publicity and pressure in Dail Eireann, the lower house of the Irish Parliament, the government announced it was setting up an official Commission of Investigation. The body was required to provide answers by 2018. Indeed, some modest interim findings have since been released, but two years since its official publication date, the full report has still not seen the light of day.

This June, partially in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the report was again delayed until October 2020.

In its absence, the suspicion, frustration and anger of relatives have mushroomed. And the once shameful secret of a single small rural town is developing into a broader and more profound national scandal; an affair which goes to the heart of the close relationship between successive Irish governments and the Catholic Church.

In two special episodes of People and Power, from filmmakers Callum Macrae, Mark Williams and Al Jazeera correspondent Laurence Lee, we investigate deeply disturbing allegations that both the Irish state and its religious orders were responsible for a systematic decades-long regime of institutional neglect and exploitation involving the death of thousands of children.
