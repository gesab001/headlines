   <media:description>Time was running out for this old street dog. We rescued her just in time for life-saving surgery. An enormous and rapidly-growing abdominal tumor was within weeks --maybe days--of growing into her vital organs. Janvi's astounding peacefulness is a deep part of her nature. The trust she gave us can probably be credited to the kindness of her human neighbors who were so glad to welcome her back after surgery. Janvi has every chance for a bright future, and she has a glowing present life, too. With help, even a big problem can disappear.

   <media:description>Whoever says animals can't speak hasn't met Orlando. His sorrowful cries told a group of strangers that he was in excruciating pain and needed help. His worrying eyes expressed his confusion when we brought him to the examination table. And his adoring smile announced as clear as a bell that he loved his care-giver, Dhapu. Meet Orlando, whose injuries were invisible, so he told us all about them. Animals can speak. They say &quot;I hurt.&quot; They say &quot;I feel better now.&quot; And they say Thank You.

   <media:description>Multiple wounds tore open this puppy's neck, shoulders and ear, we rescued this puppy as he sat trembling and woozy with pain. We hurriedly gave the beautiful little victim pain medicine, hydration drip, bandaging and food, but the best part of his rescue was holding him close and experiencing the marvel of his recovery. Within days, Tiggy's incredibly playfulness and boundless affection took over. 
There's nothing better than a happy ending. Please donate. https://www.animalaidunlimited.org/donate/</media:description>

   <media:description>When we got the call that a puppy was covered in blood we had no idea how bad it could be. The entire skin, muscle and tissue flap that attaches to a dog's lower gums had been ripped away from the bone. As soon as we examined her in the hospital we realized that surgery was the only way to save her life, and even if we saved it today, we weren't sure what might happen to the exposed jaw during the coming days.

This angel's lower lips, and all the skin under the jaw, had to be removed. There was simply nothing to attach it to. The gum tissue wasn't strong enough to hold sutures. And she had to be able to open her mouth to eat. Even bandaging the area would be impossible.  We had never before performed a surgery to remove so much tissue from a dog's muzzle.

Watch this simply extraordinary recovery. We've called this little hero Joy, and you'll see why.

   <media:description>The family who occasionally feeds this street dog could barely recognize him when he showed up in front of their house after a long disappearance. Hairless, his face was encrusted and blistered with mange, and his skin was almost purple from scratching. But he responded to medical help incredibly fast. He was accustomed to human kindness and treating him was a pleasure. We were able to return him to his neighborhood within just a few weeks, neutered and mange-free, and you can see in the final scenes that Duggu was just ecstatic to be back with his people. 

Let's get someone home. Healed.

   <media:description>When we first saw this skinny puppy it looked like he had been hit by a car, but then his neighbors told us that he had stopped eating and suddenly was unable to stand. When we examined him in the hospital we determined by his nasal discharge, diarrhea and loss of appetite that he probably had canine distemper, a virus that can be fatal and for which there is no direct treatment. Because distemper sufferers often develop what's called secondary pneumonia, we gave him preventive antibiotics and were so happy that he began eating within the first day. He was so sensitive that it seemed like love was as important to him as food itself and we wondered if his condition could have improved without it. He didn't stand for quite a few days, and when he did, he seemed to be propelled by his will to give love. Meet Sparkle now!

   <media:description>We really didn't believe a crocodile had attacked this cow when the neighbors called to report her injury. But she had been grazing just near Madar Lake, which is home to small crocodiles who have been seen by many farmers over the years. When we saw her wound, we gasped, and we believed. This probably wasn't a false report; we think she really was attacked by a crocodile. Nothing else could explain the jagged edges of this enormous, deep and life-threatening wound. We were unable to suture it closed because there was insufficient skin remaining. We closed the wound with a smaller flap of skin, and stitched into place thread which would secure daily wound dressings for more than 100 days to come. Meet beautifully-healed Emma today.

   <media:description>Lockdown in India has been so hard for street animals whose normal source of food comes from vendors, leftovers from restaurants or human tiffins, and the kindness of people who casually have the habit of sharing their last roti with a passing dog or cow; who feed the crispy end of their samosa at the chaiwala to the little tail-wagger at his feet; sabjiwalas who offer their damaged fruit and vegetables to whatever big beauty is wandering by. With the lockdown, the streets are silent and most of the usual sources of food for street animals disappeared overnight.  Like thousands--perhaps millions--of people across India, we realized a few days into the lockdown that the problem was quickly becoming urgent. As you can see from these faces, each individual is beautifully grateful.
And so are we, to the donors who have provided 2000 chapatis a day and money for the kibble, the rice, the dal, the petrol, and to the animal lovers across India to whom we dedicate this little video.

   <media:description>Two deadly conditions meant survival was unlikely for this emaciated young street dog. Half her face had been eaten by maggots and she was also suffering from the often- fatal canine distemper virus. For many days we prepared ourselves for the chance that she would &quot;go down hill&quot; because fighting that virus calls for incredible strength. To have your strength simultaneously used to heal from a devastating and huge wound, it's just hard to imagine anyone surviving. Her body seemed so fragile and defeated when we rescued her. But her strength must have come from her soul. After weeks of treatment and love, meet Juliet now!

A serious wound covered in flies caused this baby intense distress. We brought both the calf (Moon) and his mother (Jupiter) to Animal Aid for his several weeks of treatment. As soon as his wound was cleaned and bandaged, his mood lightened incredibly, and he constantly invited his mom to play. It was as if he felt so secure with her always by his side that he was the perfect little patient, and she was the perfect loving angel always in the wings. 
In most dairies, including the backyard dairies in villages, when a baby is only a couple of days old, they are taken from their anguished mother cows or tied apart from her to prevent the baby from nursing or having any physical contact. Watching Jupiter and Moon, it's very clear that snuggling, grooming and touching is as important as sunlight and air. But Jupiter couldn't clean and bandage Moon's wound. That's where you come in</media:description>

The crusting from advanced mange was encasing this older dog as if he was growing gravel instead of skin. Though mange is curable, he was made so frail by this terrible skin disease that we knew he could lose his life in his battle. He touched our hearts with his quiet, understated determination. But though he was subtle, his nature was so incredibly sweet that everyone loved him as soon as they looked into his innocent eyes. And when he was healed, he was as beautiful on the outside as he was, all along, on the inside. Meet Ramu today. You can help a downcast dog lift his head again. In hope.</media:description>

Kali is a &quot;community dog&quot; with several families watching over her, but she has no guardian considering her as a personal possession and she lives like other street dogs in her neighborhood, traipsing here and there. When Kali was hit by a bike, her neighbors were distraught, but they had probably never carried a dog before, and when they saw that she couldn't get up, they called us to help her. We thought initially that she might have a spine injury because she couldn't bear weight on any of her legs, but after a few days we came to believe it might have been a head injury that caused her problems balancing and a sense of disorientation after she began to be able to stand and move a little bit. Her loving nature would not hear of giving up, though, and she most cheerfully loved her physio-therapy sessions. Gradually, her orientation returned, and we were able to bring her back to the loving neighbors who she had missed so much. Kali's reunion with them is beautiful. Happiness is...getting someone home soon. 
Rescued on: 13/Feb/2020</media:description>

Angelo is a bull who we found in excruciating pain with multiple ropes digging through the flesh of his front leg clear to the bone. The wound was a result of someone having tightly tied his leg to his horns--a devastating technique used by ignorant farmers to keep cows from escaping, and to prevent bulls from mating because they cannot lift their heads. Usually a single rope is tied, and you often see cows crouched and hobbling down the roads with their heads bent low, and you can almost feel the horrendous neck strain. But in Angelo's case, the abuse was compounded with time and perhaps with the extra shortness of the rope. He very likely had no owner but the dairyman whose cows lived in this bull's neighborhood perhaps only wanted to breed his cows artificially using the sperm of foreign breeds, which are often thought to produce more milk. For Angelo, it almost ended his life. But Angelo, whose only experience with human hands had been to suffer human cruelty, just radiated sweetness. Even during daily wound dressings that must have sometimes been painful, Angelo seemed to understand that we were trying our best to help him. His eyes are soft; his face composed and loving.  Within a month, his bandages could come off, and this is the &quot;person&quot; Angelo is when his suffering is all behind him. 
Let's turn cruelty to kindness.</media:description>

Olivia's story is a simple rescue of a piglet with a wound in her neck. Her treatment and recovery are made sweeter by loving care from people, which she desperately needed because she is very young and we couldn't find her mother. But there's another story here--about her intelligence, humor, playfulness, and sensitivity. Qualities most pigs had at birth, but were never allowed to explore or develop. By the time you have finished watching this happy little 4-minute video, thousands of pigs will have been killed in the meat industry. Each of these individuals have qualities like Olivia's. Each one wanted to think, to create, to play, to feel this magical earth beneath her little toes, just like Olivia is doing now. #EveryPigIsOlivia 
Precious. Life.</media:description>
