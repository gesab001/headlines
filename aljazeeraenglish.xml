   <media:description>The response to COVID-19 crisis is becoming increasingly political, with calls for an inquiry into how it has been handled worldwide.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has defended his country's response as open and transparent during an annual health conference run by the World Health Organization.
But Beijing has been facing growing criticism.

   <media:description>Africa's wildlife is one of the continent's biggest attractions. 
Game reserves and national parks welcome millions of visitors every year, who want to experience wild animals up close.
They rely on that revenue to pay for conservation projects.
But now, revenue flow has stopped entirely because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.
And many rangers who protect the animals from poachers have lost their incomes.
Conservationists are worried the economic toll could push more people into the illegal wildlife trade.
Will decades of work to protect animals be lost?

   <media:description>India has extended the world’s biggest lockdown by another two weeks but eased some restrictions.
Markets are allowed to open for the first time in eight weeks and travel between states is permitted in personal vehicles and buses.
That is despite the number of cases continuing to rise, with nearly 100,000 infections and more than 3,000 deaths.

   <media:description>Malaysia's king has warned politicians against creating another political crisis as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.
His comments came as parliament convened briefly for the first time since a power grab in March.
The session was kept short over fears of spreading coronavirus.
The short session means new Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has avoided a no-confidence vote for now.

   <media:description>China is trying to walk a line between quelling scattered outbreaks of coronavirus and restoring a semblance of day-to-day normality. But concerns are mounting over the possible impact of the virus on hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims, many of whom are being held in so-called “training and education” camps that United Nations experts say are in flagrant disregard of international human rights law.

Uighur rights activists, as well as the relatives of those interned in the western province of Xinjiang, say cramped, unhygienic conditions in the camps allow the untrammelled spread of coronavirus. As COVID-19 cases in China increased earlier this year they urged the World Health Organization to seek a fact-finding mission to the region. Beijing responded by downplaying the risks of coronavirus in the Muslim-majority province, saying that the vast majority of those in the camps had since “graduated” and been released.  

As China tries to repair an economy dented by the coronavirus outbreak, Uighur rights advocates now say authorities are resuming job placements for Uighurs, moving them far from their families and homes. A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute alleges that authorities have transferred thousands of Uighurs to work in factories producing goods for some of the world's biggest brands, while keeping them under close watch. Authorities in Xinjiang, as well as companies accused of benefiting from forced labour, say the report is a smear – highlighting the stark divisions over the treatment of Uighurs and the rights they hold in China. 

On Monday’s episode of The Stream, we’ll be joined by Uighur voices to hear what's at stake for the wider community as China focuses on its fight against coronavirus. Join the conversation.

The anti-government protesters, arrested in April, appeared in a Hong Kong court over mass rallies.
They are accused of helping to organise protests which were banned by the city's authorities.

   <media:description>As countries across the world enlist the help of technology to fight the coronavirus, a showdown is brewing between public health experts, government officials and privacy advocates.

Digital tracking apps work by notifying people about their possible exposure to coronavirus-positive patients, and advising them to self-quarantine.

Eager to restart the economy and end lockdowns, many countries are embracing the technology. Most apps use GPS or Bluetooth data to help identify and quell outbreak clusters.

But privacy advocates warn that this type of digital tracing is vulnerable to abuse, especially if an individual's personal data falls into the wrong hands. The move could also usher in a new age of government surveillance that remains even after the pandemic abates.

Still, absent a vaccine, it’s likely that most nations will use some form of technology to track coronavirus outbreaks going forward.

In this episode we ask, do we have to sacrifice our privacy to fight the coronavirus?

The transport minister said residents who want to move will be compensated.
But many Egyptians say the project is yet another example of corruption within the government.

   <media:description>A fight has broken out in Hong Kong's parliament.
There was fury from pro-democracy politicians after a pro-Beijing politician was elected as chairwoman for a key committee.
 
And, 15 anti-government protesters are appearing in a Hong Kong court, charged over last year's mass rallies. 
The group was arrested in April, accused of helping to organise protests which were banned by the city's authorities.
UN human rights experts have called for all of them to be released and for charges to be dropped.
The first Hong Kong protester to admit to rioting charges was sentenced to four years in prison on Friday
Al Jazeera's Adrian Brown reports.

And infections in Russia are still rising at an alarming rate.
