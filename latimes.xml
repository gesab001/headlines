Leon is shown with her two sons Omar Ramirez, 4, left, and Esgar Ramirez, 7, in their room. Leon shares a two bedroom one bath house with another family of four. Odilia pays $1050 a month for one room where she sleeps with her five children. She fears for her health and the health of her three children during the coronavirus pandemic. In Monterey County, agriculture workers make up 40% of positive COVID-19 cases and two-thirds of cases are concentrated among Latinos. Farmworkers often live multiple families to a home because of unaffordable housing and low wages. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
