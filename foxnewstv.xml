There has been a lot of talk about defunding the police. Supporters say it is about stripping away some of the police departments' budgets and shifting responsibilities. President Trump says it will never happen and it's sure to be an issue in the presidential race. Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, discusses the debate over defunding the police, Joe Biden's apparent lead over the president and more signs the coronavirus could impact the 2020 election.

Can there be a true national standard for policing across the U.S.? How much power does Congress have when it comes to reforming local police protocols? FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains whether the federal government can do anything. Judge Napolitano also weighs in on the renewed cries to remove Confederate statues and if there are any legal issues in renaming military bases.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of &quot;Fox Across America.&quot;
