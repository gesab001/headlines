   <media:description>In the wake of Donald Trump's surprise election win in 2016, CNN's Van Jones went on a journey of discovery across America to understand why voters sent Trump to Washington.
Today, as the country wrestles with the death of George Floyd in police custody, the protest movement that grew from it, and the national conversation about race that is reverberating in every corner of American life, Jones revisited three of those voters who backed Trump in 2016 to see how they are experiencing this moment in history.

   <media:description>Facebook  removed a video posted by President Donald Trump's account that had twisted a viral video of two toddlers after one of the children's parents lodged a copyright claim. The video had more than 4 million views by the time Facebook took it down.

The now-removed clip is a crude and misleading edit of a video that went viral last year which shows a Black child and a White child running to hug each other. The version posted to Trump's account made it first appear as if the Black child was running away from the White child.
Jukin Media, a company that represents creators of videos including the parent who owns this video, said in a statement provided to CNN Business Friday afternoon, &quot;Neither the video owner nor Jukin Media gave the President permission to post the video, and after our review, we believe that his unauthorized usage of the content is a clear example of copyright infringement without valid fair use or other defense.&quot;
Jukin said in its statement that it had submitted a takedown request to Twitter (TWTR). As of Friday afternoon, the video remained on Twitter, which had no comment. Jukin did not confirm it had sent the takedown request to Facebook, but Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesperson, said &quot;We received a copyright complaint from the rights holder of this video under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and have removed the post.&quot;

The video was put on Trump's Facebook account after he tweeted it Thursday night, the eve of Juneteenth, the oldest known holiday honoring the end of slavery in the United States.

   <media:description>Ten states saw a record number of new Covid-19 cases this week, and one of them could be the next epicenter of the national health crisis.
Florida reported 3,207 additional coronavirus cases on Thursday -- the largest single-day count in the state since the pandemic, according to the state health department. Florida's total reported cases climbed to nearly 86,000, according to data.
The Sunshine State has &quot;all the markings of the next large epicenter of coronavirus transmission,&quot; and risks being the &quot;worst it has ever been,&quot; according to projections from a model by scientists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.
&quot;That makes me very worried because, at the numbers they're now seeing, it's very easy to start doubling and lose control of the epidemic,&quot; Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN
Rubin said model predictions are matched by actual cases in Florida and by increasing hospitalizations from Tampa to Orlando to Miami-Dade County and up the east and west coasts of the state.

   <media:description>Facebook said it had taken action against ads run by President Trump's re-election campaign for breaching its policies on hate. The ads, which attacked what the Trump campaign described as &quot;Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups,&quot; featured an upside-down triangle.

The Anti-Defamation League said Thursday the triangle &quot;is practically identical to that used by the Nazi regime to classify political prisoners in concentration camps.&quot;
&quot;We removed these posts and ads for violating our policy against organized hate. Our policy prohibits using a banned hate group's symbol to identify political prisoners without the context that condemns or discusses the symbol,&quot; Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesperson, told CNN Business.
The hate group to which Facebook was referring in its statement is Nazis, the company confirmed.
The ads targeted the far-left group antifa, calling on Trump supporters to back the President's calls to designate the group a terrorist organization.
Responding to criticism of the ad earlier Thursday, the Trump campaign claimed the red triangle was &quot;a symbol widely used by Antifa.&quot;
The campaign pointed CNN Business to several links to poster, sticker, and magnet websites that sell unofficial merchandise designed by their users that contains the symbol. The campaign did not point to any examples of antifa activists wearing the symbol.
The ADL said Thursday that some antifa activists have used the symbol, but it is not particularly common.

   <media:description>The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation.
The 5-4 ruling was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.
In penning the opinion, Roberts once again sided with the liberals on the bench in a momentous dispute that will infuriate judicial conservatives who are still bitter that he once provided the deciding vote to uphold Obamacare.
The opinion is the second time in a week when the Supreme Court -- bolstered with two of President Donald Trump's nominees -- has ruled against the Trump administration. Monday, the court said LGBTQ Americans are protected under the Civil Rights Act.
The ruling emphasizes that the administration failed to provide an adequate reason to justify ending the DACA program.
&quot;We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,&quot; Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. &quot;'The wisdom' of those decisions 'is none of our concern.' We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action.&quot;
