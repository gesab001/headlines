California air quality officials are poised to adopt their biggest pollution-cutting regulations in more than a decade, targeting diesel trucks and cargo ships that spew much of the state's cancer-causing and smog-forming emissions. The state Air Resources Board is expected to vote after a public hearing Thursday on two rules: one to establish stringent new emissions standards for heavy-duty diesel trucks and one to reduce pollution from ships docked at ports.

For an hour each Thursday afternoon, the group of four or five girls play with dolls and talk about anything from their home dynamics to their friends at school. The idea is to give these girls a space to experience their own innocence in an attempt to at least partially address the effects of adultification bias (a form of racial prejudice where children of minority groups, particularly black girls, are treated as being more mature than they actually are by a reasonable social standard of development).

Squaw Valley President & CEO Ron Cohen says resort officials are meeting with shareholders and the local Washoe tribal leadership to get their input. He says he can't give a timeline on when the decision will be made. The renaming of Squaw Valley Ski Resort is one of many efforts across the nation to address colonialism and indigenous oppression.
