   <media:description>In the Netherlands, the number of homeless people has doubled in recent years and 300,000 new houses are urgently needed. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the yearly target will not be met. 

To create both houses and jobs, local officials and developers have made an urgent plea to the government to invest billions of dollars. 

Al Jazeera's Step Vaessen reports from The Hague.

   <media:description>Black people in France face more discrimination than any other minority, according to a report by the country's National Consultative Commission on Human Rights.
The report also says police must be trained better to handle racist disputes.

   <media:description>It was just two years ago, when the leaders of North Korea and South Korea agreed to work towards peace. 
They signed a pact to stop cross-border hostilities... and for once, there was hope for reconciliation.
But now, that hope is fading. 
Pyongyang's threatened to re-deploy troops near the demilitarized border.
It also destroyed a liaison office meant to facilitate dialogue, because, it says, South Korea allowed North Korean defectors to drop anti-government leaflets into its territory. 
The government in Seoul denies that and says it will no longer tolerate North Korea's behaviour.
So, what's next for the region?

   <media:description>Just how free are women in Saudi Arabia today? The Saudi government has said it supports the empowerment of women and young people. While there have been reforms, including lifting the ban on women driving in June 2018, the arrest and detention of women speaking out against the government appear to have continued.

Al Jazeera World looks at the individual cases of five Saudi women currently in detention, or who have fled the country following apparent harassment for their political views. It asks whether Saudi Arabia is publicly championing the rights of women while privately punishing those who challenge the status quo.

In this film, the family of one detainee makes serious allegations of torture during her imprisonment, while others give testimonies about random arrests and arbitrary detention at Dhahban prison near Jeddah. According to Human Rights Watch, and following international pressure, the Saudi Human Rights Commission carried out an investigation into conditions at Dhahban and found no evidence of torture.

This film examines the consequences of activism in Saudi Arabia, hearing from women detainees and international human rights organisations, as well as seeking responses from those at the heart of decision-making within the country.

   <media:description>As the Attorney General of Minnesota, Keith Ellison is the chief prosecutor of the four policemen charged in the murder of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis on May 25.

More than 30 years ago, Ellison was a student activist in Minnesota, where he organised the community to stand up to police brutality.

Years later he became the first Muslim member of Congress, and the first Black American to be elected to a statewide position in Minnesota.

&quot;It's true that I come from a background where civil rights have been a priority my whole life, but all I've really wanted is to have fairness,&quot; he said. “Not more, not less.”

While he has not taken a public stand on the calls to &quot;defund&quot; the police, he said that one major problem between US society and the police is that &quot;there's no trust any more&quot;.

He dismissed President Donald Trump's executive order on policing, signed this week, as &quot;too little too late&quot; and urged legislators to listen to the people demanding serious police reform and accountability.

&quot;When you have an excessive force problem, you have a community cooperation problem.&quot;

Ellison argued that the struggle to rid the police of racism and militarism will be difficult, because in the end, the police are a reflection of wider society. &quot;And if our citizenry holds those kinds of biases that widespread, then, of course, our police departments do,&quot; he said.

Watch Ellison’s full interview with The Bottom Line host Steve Clemons.

   <media:description>The US has introduced more sanctions against Syria's government and its backers, warning it will not stop until President Bashar al-Assad ends the war against his own people. 
Some of those targeted are in neighbouring Lebanon. 
This is expected to worsen the country’s economic crisis as the government seeks help from the International Monetary Fund.

   <media:description>Healthcare workers in Peru have been protesting against a lack of personal protective equipment. 
Peru has one of the highest rates of coronavirus infections in South America. 
The government has rushed to test more than 200,000 people, build makeshift hospitals and fly doctors around the country, but many say it is still not doing enough to protect front-line workers.

The legislation will criminalise separatism, sedition and subversion, broad crimes for which there is still no clear definition.

   <media:description>The violent arrest of a nurse at a protest in Paris is causing outrage across France.
Riot police were filmed removing the woman from a crowd of demonstrating health workers who were demanding better pay for their work during the coronavirus pandemic.
At one point, officers dragged the 50-year-old woman by her hair. 
But police say she was arrested for throwing objects.

   <media:description>Former US national security adviser John Bolton says President Trump asked foreign leaders to help boost his re-election chances.
That is just one of a number of accusations made in excerpts of Bolton’s new book set to be released next week.
Both the US Justice Department and the White House are taking legal action to try to block it.

Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna reports from Washington, DC.

   <media:description>The war in Syria has devastated much of the country and its people. 
But president Bashar Al Assad has remained in power, with the help of his foreign allies. 
There's now another threat facing tens of millions of Syrians. 
The economy, which has been reduced to a third of its size - has been decimated.
Its currency is in freefall and there are shortages of basic goods; while prices have gone up. 
But Assad might not be able to count on his friends anymore to rebuild his state.  
New U.S. sanctions now taking effect, punish anyone who does business with his country. 
It targets politicians, institutions, businesses and those engaged in transactions with the Syrian government. 
They could be banned from travel, denied access to U.S. markets or even face arrest. 
It could also affect partners like Russia and Iran, but also those in the Gulf and Europe as well.
American officials insist the sanctions will not harm Syrian civilians. 
So, will these sanctions deny the government of a political victory after years of conflict? 
And how will Syria's allies react to the new sanctions?

   <media:description>Donald Trump will hit the campaign trail this week by holding a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma in his first major political event since the coronavirus brought the world to a standstill. 

Saturday’s rally had originally been scheduled for June 19, also known as “Juneteenth”, a holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. That date angered many people who saw it as an opportunistic political stunt, and Trump later announced on Twitter that the event would move to the following day out of respect.

The campaign appearance comes at a much needed time for Trump whose approval rating has taken several hits, in part due to his administration’s handling of the pandemic and his rhetoric around race issues, including the ‘Black Lives Matter’ protests.

On this episode of The Stream, we ask what the president can do to turn his campaign around and if it’s even impossible to pull off another win.
