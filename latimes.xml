County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

In Little Saigon in Orange County, the low number of coronavirus cases and deaths is the result of cultural habits and "consistent" behavior, according to experts and immigrants themselves.

And within extended families, people tend to appoint a representative who is the only person to venture outside buying groceries, running errands or attending to urgent matters.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - JULY 27, 2020 - - Maria Reyes, second from left, spends time with her daughters Marilyn, 9, from left, Darlene, 4, Sophia, 6, and Leilani, 5, right, near their home in Los Angeles on July 27, 2020. All four of the children have attended Head Start, one of three major publicly-funded preschool programs serving low-income California families. California's youngest learners are returning to the classroom. But in the state's neediest zip code, 90011, in where the family lives, preschools remain closed. Such programs are considered essential to closing racial and economic achievement gaps among school-aged children - yet tens of thousands of eligible preschoolers can't get spots, including almost 2,000 Maria's zip code, the state's most underserved. As private preschools across California prepare to reopen, experts fear those in public programs will be left behind, and that thousands of existing spots could disappear.
