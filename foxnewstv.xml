   <media:description>George Floyd's funeral will be followed by burial at the Houston Memorial Gardens cemetery in suburban Pearland, where he will be laid to rest next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd.

George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped responding. His death has inspired international protests and drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by police and the criminal justice system.

Former Congressman Trey Gowdy speaks with Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kim Strassel.

Kim tells Trey about how she first discovered her passion for journalism. She breaks down the difference between news and editorials and how a newspaper decides what news is worth covering. She explains how young people can ensure the news they are reading is reliable and how newspapers choose conservative and liberal voices for their editorial boards. Trey and Kim also break down why the New York Times Opinion Editor's resignation over an unpopular op-ed may damage people's faith in journalism.

Later, Trey and Kim discuss her experience covering the Russia investigation in 2016 and the importance of journalists applying the same standard to everyone.
