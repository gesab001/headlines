Violent crime is surging in major U.S. cities like Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles. At the same time, many of those cities have experienced more than two months of civil unrest in response to the death of George Floyd. Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's attorney and former New York City mayor, discusses how he'd handle the current spike in violence and how he feels about the president sending federal officers to quell the unrest. Giuliani also weighs in on Attorney General Bill Barr's heated testimony before a House committee on Tuesday.

We are less than 100 days away from the 2020 presidential election. The latest polls show President Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, but the Trump campaign is questioning the accuracy of the polls. FOX News Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt weighs in on why the president is not polling well, if he has time to turn it around, the &quot;silent majority&quot; and more.

Plus, commentary by Guy Benson, host of &quot;The Guy Benson Show&quot;
