Excruciating pain and dizziness caused by a terrible ear wound full of maggots, this old dog was almost non-responsive when neighbors spotted him and called us to the rescue. He may have only been injured like this for a few days, but maggots had so multiplied in the ear and had worsened whatever damage the initial wound had been, he may have had only a few days of life left. 

We immediately began the overnight process of removing the maggots with medicated powder, and in the morning sedated him to complete the initial flushing and removal of dead tissue and maggots. With antibiotics, the wound thoroughly cleaned, and a bandage wrapped around his ear, he started feeling better almost immediately and showed us we had revived him with a great appetite. 

This boy looked like he might be a sad, inward soul when he felt bad. But wow, when his pain had eased, he turned out to be a big cheerful smiling ol' sweetheart. We are so delighted to know that Tucker has many adventures ahead.</media:description>

Starving as she was unable to eat, this sweetheart's jaw was broken and her teeth displaced. We'd never have saved her had it not been for observant and kind neighbors who noticed the puppy wasn't eating. They immediately called us to help her, and we performed her surgery the next day. Without surgery, she would never have eaten again.  

After the procedure to remove broken teeth, wire and stitch her gums and jaw, it still hurt too much to eat normally, so we mashed her food and fed her with a syringe. But within just a few days, this girl was eating all by herself and her complete recovery was in motion.  Her neighbors pledged to watch over her, and 6 months later presented us with one of the most beautiful dogs in the neighborhood: golden, glorious Sonali.</media:description>

How this beautiful girl managed to drag herself out of the road after being hit by a vehicle, we will never know. She suffered a serious spine injury that left her completely unable to bear weight. Not just for a few days, but for 8 weeks of physiotherapy and bed-rest.  

We named her Dena, which means &quot;to give&quot; in Hindi. No matter how low she felt, when she couldn't move her legs or her body, her eyes showered her caregivers with love. But her rehabilitation was so slow that we were losing hope. With full sensation in her toes, we expected her to try to stand long before she did. 

But one fine day, 2 months after the accident with very little apparent progress, Dena was ready. All by herself, this brave girl stood and took her first trembling steps. And that was just the beginning of what has become a complete, beautiful recovery. Meet strong sweetheart Dena now!</media:description>

Meet beautiful Blessing. He is one of the gentlest angels we've ever met. He's healthy now, after weeks of daily wound cleaning and new bandages, good food and cheerful days. But oh, has he suffered. Bred for and born into labor, this young donkey never had a chance to experience life as a care-free little soul. He would have spent every day under an almost unbearable load, often &quot;managed&quot; by children too young for such immense responsibility, and not educated about animals having feelings. Adult donkey owners who abuse donkeys in this way may have a disconnection between animal suffering and it mattering that an animal is suffering.

The abuse may not be intentional. Beneath it is ignorance and possibly real indifference. Because of your help in giving us the means to rescue donkeys and publicize their abuse on social media,  awareness is growing about the vulnerability of working animals everywhere, like Blessing.

Blessing is now safe, adding his sweetness to the world.</media:description>

A wild piglet was seriously hurt with multiple puncture wounds from an animal attack. Even hours after her wounds were cleaned and bandaged, this young sweetheart trembled with fear. She had never been touched by a human hand before, and it scared her. She would need incredible bravery, but snuggled deep into her blanket for the feeling of the comfort she had known sleeping with her siblings against her mother's big body. Now she was all alone. Though she ate well, she was facing a long recovery, and she may have been significantly depressed. But someone very special was waiting for her, though none of us would have guessed. 

Just one week after her admission, we rescued another little piglet with similar puncture wounds--a little boy piglet full of his own noisy squeals and twirls. As we treated his wound, we told him he was in for a beautiful surprise. As soon as we had secured his bandages, we delighted in introducing him to his new friend. Though they were a few weeks different in age, pigs are such social and emotional beings that no questions were asked! They bonded within minutes. We felt we could see their healing accelerate from the sheer joy in each other's comfort and...play! Watch these tumble-bunnies in action.</media:description>

We can only imagine that the leopard was interrupted, though no one saw the attack--maybe this dog fought back too hard. He was in utter shock for hours after the attack to his throat and chest. Residents from a nearby village hurried him to our hospital. Saving his life seemed an almost impossible assignment. But his strength was phenomenal, and the jaws of the leopard had closed on him just millimeters short of killing him. 

His astonished eyes stayed wide as adrenalin ran through his body long after arriving in our hospital. A great amount of flesh had been simply taken, and there was insufficient skin remaining to stitch closed the wounds. We could only keep them clean and snuggly bandaged, and changed them every day for 2 months. To our amazement, this dignified boy completely healed. 

Meet Beesi today!</media:description>

This precious teenaged puppy screamed in pain when his rescuers tried to lift him. His feet had been run over by a vehicle, and one paw was crushed and degloved. His toes were splayed and swollen to twice their normal size. Standing was too excruciating to bear. Had he been an older dog with more brittle bones, he might have been facing an amputation, but this young boy still had soft bones. 

We treated his wound and wrapped his intensely painful feet in thick bandages which we changed every day. The little guy was one of the most careful young patients we've ever had. He seemed determined to cause no fuss. But he was so inward we wondered if he was depressed. Then, when he'd progressed a bit on his healing journey, well, this boy burst out in song. Meet Elvis now!</media:description>

Few injuries are more horrible to imagine than a ruptured eyeball, but this gentle boy's eye had ruptured. His suffering was extreme. The wound may have been caused by a passing vehicle hitting his head from behind. His excruciating pain had exhausted him, and he completely gave himself to his rescuer without the slightest resistance. 

Maybe he knew he was in safe hands. But could he know that those safe hands would hold him tight for the rest of his life?

It was evening when he arrived at the hospital, and to prepare him for surgery in the morning we treated him for pain and made sure he did not eat or drink prior to surgery. His eye could not be saved, but the procedure went well, and he woke up from surgery immediately relieved. But only then did we realize, Sammy was also blind in the other eye. We've welcomed him to live for the rest of his life in the happy sanctuary of Animal Aid. What a snugglebug he has become, and we hope you'll join us in falling in love with Sammy.</media:description>

This little donkey's wound on his backside must have multiplied in size and depth once maggots began destroying the live tissue. Still energetic and optimistic, this precious boy, who we called Micky, seemed to have no idea that he was in grave danger and would have died without urgent rescue. 

His mother's love would be a vital comfort to him, so of course we brought them together, and Mom's face, within moments, seemed to express relief that they were now in safe, healing hands. 

Watch now, as Micky's fear, during the days to come, turned into love.</media:description>

When a neighbor saw a young dog who was too weak to climb out of a gutter, they called our rescue team. Gently, when we lifted her, we saw that she had multiple puncture wounds and was completely weak. Once back at the hospital we treated her with IV fluids for shock, but her condition was declining, and she took short rapid breaths. 

It was nighttime and she was able to feel secure in the quiet of her kennel bed. By morning, her breathing had normalized, but she was still collapsed. Even eating was impossible for her to do alone. But within a few days, her sparkle was returning and we caught a glimpse of her first tail wag. 

Meet adorable Chickpea now!</media:description>

This sweetheart suffered with mange probably most of her short life, and the mange was winning: she had collapsed in the corner of a shed and would never have stood up again if rescuers had not arrived. 

At the sound of our voices, she found the strength to wag her tail, and her black button eyes told us all we needed to know. She needed help or she would die. We hurried her to the hospital and gave her an IV drip to hydrate and nourish her. By morning she was already slightly improved, and we began treating her infected wounds and mange. 

Her progress was immediate, and with delight we helped give her the care and love she needed to blossom. Meet Cotton now!

A desperate dog swimming in circles and near drowning with exhaustion; a dog stuck upside down in a narrow passageway; a young bull who would have been stuck until death after falling in a well, and other extreme disasters for street animals who could not survive without the help of human beings. 

Again and again, it's the neighbors who waste no time in calling our ambulance, helping lift animals to safety and lifting our hearts. Your heart will race just watching these astounding rescues.</media:description>

Hiding in pain and wailing when touched, this dog had been hit by a car, her hind leg fractured and partially degloved; her front leg sliced deeply at the top. But as soon as she understood she was safe in the arms of her rescuer, this girl stopped howling and wagged her tail. Unbelievable! 

And when we eased her pain with medication, wound dressing, splint and surgery on her forearm wound, she gave us the most beautiful reward: non-stop smiles filled with love throughout the coming weeks of her healing. 

Bessie's one of the precious souls who lives life like a song of gratitude, to the air, the earth; to her animal friends, to us, and to you.</media:description>
