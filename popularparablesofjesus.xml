Jesus is asked to judge an inheritance dispute, but instead He uses this divisive conflict between brothers to affirm the eternal ideals of His Beatitudes which He taught in the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus teaches the wronged brother to forgive and love his brother. All who follow Jesus must learn that what we own has little to do with who we are.

The Good Samaritan  
(Luke 10:25-37, Matthew 22:34-40, Mark 12:28-34)

Luke 10:25-37  25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, &quot;Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;  26 And He said to him, &quot;What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?&quot;  27 And he answered and said, &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.&quot;  28 And He said to him, &quot;You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.&quot;  29 But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, &quot;And who is my neighbor?&quot;  30 Jesus replied and said, &quot;A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went off leaving him half dead.  31 &quot;And by chance a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.  32 &quot;And likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.  33 &quot;But a certain Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion,  34 and came to him, and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  35 &quot;And on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return, I will repay you.'  36 &quot;Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers' hands?&quot;  37 And he said, &quot;The one who showed mercy toward him.&quot; And Jesus said to him, &quot;Go and do the same.&quot;</media:description>

Enrich your children's lives with the most popular and trustworthy, animated stories from the Bible. The NEST Complete Learning System on DVD includes 36 entertaining, educational, and interactive DVDs which will help you train your kids to become spiritual champions! Our children's animated Bible stories include Jesus' most beloved Parables, the First Christmas Story, the Passion of Christ and his Jesus' Resurrection on Easter, and many more animated bible stories.

Lord, I Believe is a collection of three stories on DVD where Jesus teaches His disciples the power of faith. First, a kind Roman centurion kneels before the Master and pleads for his dying servant. The servant is healed because he asked in faith nothing doubting. Saying &quot;weep not,&quot; Jesus raises the son of the poor widow of Nain. Lastly, a man with weak faith begs the Master to make his son whole. Jesus answers, &quot; all things are possible to him that believeth,&quot; and heals the child.
