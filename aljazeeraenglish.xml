   <media:title>Can the UK stamp out racism in its policing? | The Stream</media:title>

   <media:description>A string of arrests by police of people who allegedly racially abused Black players in the England national football team has highlighted the ugly extent of everyday racism in the United Kingdom. But with institutional racism in the UK also a persistent problem, police forces themselves are being challenged to address racially discriminatory practices.

A recent report by a watchdog that assesses policing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland found that police are still disproportionately using their powers against Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals. The HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services found that Black individuals are 5.7 times more likely to have force used against them by police, compared to white people. The report also says that Black people are almost nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people.

About two-thirds of minority ethnic people surveyed by Hope Not Hate in 2020 feel the police are biased against them. In one major case, justice campaigners want greater scrutiny into how Dyfed-Powys police handled an incident where Siyanda Mngaza alleged she had been racially attacked following a dispute – but was instead the only person arrested. She was later charged and imprisoned.

The HM Inspector of Constabulary Wendy Williams says racial disproportionality in policing may pull more Black and ethnic minority individuals into the criminal justice system, in turn hampering their education and work prospects and hurting families. But Home Secretary Priti Patel continues to defend stop and search and is sponsoring a bill that would expand police powers.

Rights groups are among those warning that the proposed legislation “will only increase racial disparities” in policing. Meanwhile, Black and minority officers have reported racism at work that ultimately undermines efforts to build a service more representative of the wider public.

In this episode of The Stream, we’ll look at how police forces in the UK disproportionately target Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, and what reforms are needed to end racial disparities in policing.

   <media:description>The English city, Liverpool, has been stripped of its coveted UNESCO World Heritage status. &#13;
The UN body blamed years of uncontrolled urbanisation for an irreversible loss of Liverpool’s Victorian-era docks, but many in the city see the move as an opportunity for regeneration.&#13;
Al Jazeera's Neave Barker reports from Liverpool.&#13;

   <media:description>For more than a week, South Africa had been beset by its worst violence since the end of apartheid.&#13;
While, the situation is largely calm now, the nation is still trying to come to terms with what happened.&#13;
The violence has killed at least 276 people and caused widespread destruction.&#13;
Hundreds of businesses were either looted or set on fire.&#13;
The unrest was sparked by the jailing of former president Jacob Zuma but expanded to include grievances about poverty and inequality.&#13;
Will the governing ANC review its policies to prevent such unrest in the future?&#13;

   <media:description>For more than 20 years, Chris Matthews made a name for himself on the nightly TV show, Hardball on MSNBC, where he became famous for grilling American politicians and breaking down the country’s politics.

Less known is that he was a politician himself once, running for Congress in the mid-1970s, and working for former President Jimmy Carter.

From his front-row seat to decades of American history, Matthews tells host Steve Clemons about a different time in US politics. But has politicking changed much between the presidency of Richard Nixon and Donald Trump? Decide for yourself after watching this wide-ranging conversation.

   <media:description>The British government says it is increasing its efforts with France to stop undocumented migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. &#13;
On Monday, at least 430 made the dangerous journey - a new daily record. &#13;
But with the numbers rising, some say the only solution is legal safe routes. &#13;

   <media:description>At its closest point, the Greek island of Samos lies barely two kilometres off the coast of Turkey, which has long made it a target destination for refugees and migrants seeking to enter Europe.

Those who make it across the Aegean Sea are housed in and around a camp close to the capital Vathy. Some have been there for years, waiting for their paperwork to be processed through the tortuously slow Greek bureaucracy.

Living conditions are atrocious. In the official camp, people sleep in dangerously overcrowded re-purposed shipping containers. But most are forced to set up tents or build a makeshift shelter in the unofficial &quot;jungle&quot;, which surrounds the original compound on an exposed hillside.

A new centre is under construction, on a mountaintop 10km (6 miles) away, and there is hope that conditions there might be better, but that is little consolation for those still living in squalor.

In late 2020, a team of filmmakers went to meet some of the people desperately hoping their ordeal will end.

   <media:description>Tanzania’s main opposition party, the Party for Democracy and Progress, also known as Chadema, says police have detained their leader Freeman Mbowe.&#13;
Ten other party members were also held early on Wednesday before Mbowe was scheduled to announce demands for constitutional reforms at a conference.&#13;
The police say the gathering contravened COVID-19 rules.&#13;
But critics say President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who took office in March&#13;
is showing signs of being as autocratic as her predecessor John Magufuli. &#13;

   <media:description>As athletes from across the world start to gather in the isolation bubble system that the Tokyo Games imposed to control COVID-19, there is a risk that infections could spread more widely from within.&#13;
The positive tests among athletes have stoked fears of a possible outbreak in the Olympic Village that would be a nightmare scenario for organisers.&#13;
Hugs, handshakes and high fives are banned in the Olympic and Paralympic Village, and competitors could be kicked out of the games if they ignore regulations.&#13;
Tokyo remains under a state of emergency, and competitors face unparalleled restrictions on their movements.&#13;

   <media:description>The sounds of classical instruments and the voices of impatient teachers resonate through South Korean music schools. The country has become a breeding ground for young performers making their mark on the world stage.

South Koreans have won lots of recent international classical music competitions. But behind these success stories are childhoods crammed with endless hours of practice, with some starting lessons at just two years of age.

101 East goes backstage to meet South Korea’s musical prodigies and find out the secrets to their success.
