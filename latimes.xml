On May 31 Price said he was walking home after visiting friends and was stopped by deputies. He doesn't know why they stopped him but eventually was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon other than a gun. "My ribs were fractured," Price said about his rough treatment." "I was mostly scared for my life," he said. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

Leon is shown with her two sons Omar Ramirez, 4, left, and Esgar Ramirez, 7, in their room. Leon shares a two bedroom one bath house with another family of four. Odilia pays $1050 a month for one room where she sleeps with her five children. She fears for her health and the health of her three children during the coronavirus pandemic. In Monterey County, agriculture workers make up 40% of positive COVID-19 cases and two-thirds of cases are concentrated among Latinos.
