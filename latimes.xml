Los Angeles campuses will not reopen for classes on Aug. 18, and the nation's second-largest school system will continue with online learning until further notice, because of the worsening coronavirus surge, Supt. Austin Beutner announced Monday. "Let me be crystal clear," Beutner said in an interview with The Times. "We all know the best place for students to learn is in a school setting." But, he said, "We're going in the wrong direction. And as much as we want to be back at schools and have students back at schools - can't do it until it's safe and appropriate."

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[SYLMAR, CA - JULY 14, 2020 - - One of the 32 chimpanzees that still resides at the shuttered Wildlife Waystation on World Chimpanzee Day in the Angeles National Forest in Sylmar on July 14, 2020. The fate of the chimpanzees is uncertain because reputable sanctuaries willing to take them lack the funding needed to give the animals permanent new homes, officials say. The challenge now is finding the roughly $7 million it will take to build accommodations for the chimps at four reputable sanctuaries across the nation. A fundraiser was announced to help the sanctuaries take on these chimpanzees and to assist with the current care expenses of the primates while they wait at the Wildlife Waystation. More than 500 exotic animals including lions, tigers, alligators, wolves, owls and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs have been relocated since the troubled 44-year-old center surrendered its California Department of Fish and Wildlife permits and shut down a year ago.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - SEPTEMBER 28, 2018 - LAPD Chief Michel Moore talks to recruits during uniform inspection of this graduating class at the Los Angeles Police Department graduation exercises for Recruit Officer Class of April 16, 2018 happening at the LAPD Elysian Park Academy on September 28, 2018. Officer John Beaty talks about being an African American recruit and about why he joined the LAPD. In this class, three of the 34 graduates are African American (10 Caucasian, 21 Hispanic, no Asians). Much has been made of the LAPD's ethnic demographics roughly mirroring those of the city. But the impact of policing still falls disproportionately on black residents. The percentage of officers who are black - roughly 9% - will soon plummet. A huge number of black officers will soon retire and recent academy classes consistently have only a few black members. New Police Chief Michel Moore says black recruiting is one of his main priorities. But in the post-Ferguson era, theres a struggle to fight the forces discouraging young black people from becoming police officers. LAPD officers in the field today say they are facing unprecedented hostility from other black people, both in the field and at home, who view them as sellouts.

Los Angeles campuses will not reopen for classes on Aug. 18, and the nation's second-largest school system will continue with online learning until further notice, because of the worsening coronavirus surge, Supt. Austin Beutner announced Monday. "Let me be crystal clear," Beutner said in an interview with The Times. "We all know the best place for students to learn is in a school setting." But, he said, "We're going in the wrong direction. And as much as we want to be back at schools and have students back at schools - can't do it until it's safe and appropriate."
