Volunteers with the Pico Union Project hand out produce and other necessities to needy residents and families in the area on Tuesdays and Fridays at 12:30. The Pico Union Project has been handing out food to the community twice a month in recent years -- but began doing so twice a week when the coronavirus hit and needs grew more dire. The Pico Union Project is a seven-year effort to help one of the city's poorest community from a community center located in a historic building that began its life in 1909 as a synagogue and then became a church before musician Craig Taubman bought it in 2013 and began reaching out to the surrounding community.

The statue in San Francisco was defaced with red paint and graffiti, the day before a federal holiday celebrating the 15th century Italian navigator. Officials say the statue at the foot of Coit Tower in the city's North Beach neighborhood was vandalized sometime Saturday night or Sunday morning. Someone poured red paint over it and drew anarchy symbols and messages on the concrete base that read "Destroy all monuments of genocide" and "Kill all colonizers." City workers cleaned the statue Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019, as thousands celebrated Italian culture. (AP Photo/File)]]></media:description>
