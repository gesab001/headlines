<description>"Many others have [already lost their jobs]. So hopefully for me, [the solution is a] conditional stimulus package. You can be given a grant as long as you keep your employees so that your employees can have a job. Then give them the remuneration that they deserve...if it's a stimulus package that you don't have to pay but you promise the government to keep people employed, it's a bigger thing."</description>
