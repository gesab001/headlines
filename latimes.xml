California's court leaders expressed alarm Wednesday over a new study that showed more than 100 courthouses in the state - including many in Los Angeles County - could collapse and cause "substantial" loss of life in a major earthquake. Courthouses near the top of the list of buildings in peril include the Stanley Mosk Courthouse and Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center, the Pasadena municipal courthouse, and courthouses in Beverly Hills and Burbank.
