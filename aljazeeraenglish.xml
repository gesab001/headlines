   <media:description>South Korea is further easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions, with sport leagues getting under way again.
The baseball season is up and running after being postponed in March.
But, as Al Jazeera's Rob McBride reports from Incheon, it will be some time before it is business as usual.

   <media:description>The world's largest hornet, a 2-inch killer dubbed the &quot;Murder Hornet&quot; with an appetite for honey bees, has been found in the United States in Washington state, where entomologists were making plans to wipe it out.
The giant Asian insect, with a sting that could be fatal to some humans, is just now starting to emerge from winter hibernation.

   <media:description>&quot;The bad news is that everyone is a potential victim. But the good news is that everyone is a potential solution...Sensitise the masses to sanitise. Keep a social distance and quarantine.&quot;
 
These are the words of Bobi Wine and Nubian Li in their campaigning anthem &quot;Corona Virus Alert,&quot; released to raise awareness of the pandemic in Uganda. The video, which only came out last month, has almost two million views on YouTube. 
 
The song is just the latest chapter in a career that has fused music icon status with politics. Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has called on the Ugandan government to improve public services as part of its strategy to defeat the virus. He has also criticised other African governments for not maintaining better health care systems for their populations, while investing in weapons and &quot;curtailing the voices of the people&quot;. 
 
Uganda has had less than 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus and the country remains in lockdown. There are risks looming, though. It is home to more than one million refugees, primarily from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo - the biggest refugee population in Africa. Many experts fear the virus could have a devastating impact if it reaches the refugee camps. 
 
An elected member of parliament, Wine last year announced that in 2021 he would run for president against the country’s longtime leader Yoweri Museveni. His music is now banned, he’s been arrested several times, and he is barred from holding rallies for his People Power Party. He is also fighting a charge of treason that is likely to follow him into election year. 
 
In this episode of The Stream, Bobi Wine joins us from Kampala to perform his new song and to talk about public health and the coronavirus in Uganda.

   <media:description>Attempts by China's leaders to divert attention from early coverups of the coronavirus outbreak seem to be backfiring.
Airlifts of medical supplies from China to Europe's worst hit countries have been quickly forgotten.
And Australia is calling for an international inquiry into COVID-19's origins.
China's ambassador responded by threatening boycotts of Australian beef and wine.
Chinese envoys in Germany and France have come under fire for criticising how governments there are dealing with the pandemic.
Can China overcome suspicion of its motives and regain trust?

   <media:description>As most of the world hunkered down and tried to get used to life under lockdown, Sweden decided to try something very different. 

It has not imposed social distancing. It has merely asked its citizens to voluntarily do it. Bars, restaurants, gyms and most schools remain open. People may gather in groups of up to 50. The strategy has broad support from the Swedish public but is not without its critics. More than 2,000 experts have signed an open letter calling for stronger action. 

Sweden's per capita death rate is much higher than that of neighbouring countries such as Norway and Denmark, both of which have gone into lockdown.

Critics have also accused the government of pursuing herd immunity, which is achieved when such a large percentage of the population has had the illness that it will stop spreading. The government denies that, while conceding that its plan could perhaps lead to herd immunity.

Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who has become the face of the strategy, has said that, while the government is confident it has chosen the right course of action, it is not sure and is constantly reevaluating. Tegnell says the overarching goals of the policy are to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and to have less strict measures than other countries so that those measures can be maintained over a long period.

In this episode of The Stream, we ask if Sweden's experiment will succeed or backfire.

   <media:description>One of the toughest coronavirus lockdowns in Asia is to be eased even further. 
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam says schools can reopen later this month, along with some businesses, cinemas, and bars.
People started returning to work on Monday.

   <media:description>ABS-CBN, the Philippines' largest television network, has been ordered to cease operations after President Rodrigo Duterte's allies in Congress refused to renew the station's 25-year licence.

In an order issued on Tuesday, the government agency tasked with awarding broadcasting licences said &quot;absent a valid Congressional Franchise, as required by law&quot;, the network should stop its various television and radio operations.

   <media:description>With most flights grounded, low-paid airport workers across the United States have been hit hard by layoffs.

Now, those who remain, are facing years of financial hardship.

   <media:description>Scientists in Iran are ramping up efforts to fight COVID-19, with a focus on new, locally-produced testing kits.
Iran was one of the hardest-hit countries in the early stages of the pandemic and faced criticism for its slow response.
But daily deaths have fallen to their lowest level in weeks, and there are growing signs of recovery.
It has been the worst affected country in the Middle East.

   <media:description>In many parts of the US, gatherings are prohibited, but people are not barred from going outdoors. 
Nicer weather is bringing more people outside, which means more challenges for law enforcement.

   <media:description>Nearly half a million refugees living in Kenya’s camps face overcrowding and poor sanitation.
