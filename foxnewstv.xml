Joe Biden accepted the Democratic nomination for President Thursday night, closing out the four-day Democratic National Convention with his pitch to Americans on why they should vote for him in November and end, as he calls it, this chapter of &quot;American darkness.&quot; FOX News Radio's National Correspondent Jared Halpern and FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar recap the final night with former Congressman Harold Ford Jr. (D-TN).

With the DNC at an end, the GOP now prepares for the Republican National Convention which will kick off next week. Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, attended his first presidential convention in 1964. Now 56 years later, he has covered several presidential campaigns -- none of which were like the one we're witnessing this year. Wallace discusses the conventions, the controversy over early voting and why he thinks election season will only continue to get stranger.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT).

The FOX News Rundown is a news-based daily morning podcast. Each morning, Jacqui Heinrich, Dave Anthony, Lisa Brady, Jessica Rosenthal and Chris Foster take a deep dive into the major and controversial stories of the day, tapping into the massive reporting resources of FOX News to provide a full picture of the news. You'll hear a contrast of perspectives you may not hear elsewhere while going far beyond the basic headlines. Each day The FOX News Rundown features insight from top newsmakers, along with FOX News reporters and contributors, plus a daily commentary on a significant issue of the day. Check us out each morning.
