   <media:description>The now-fired Atlanta Police officer who faces a felony murder charge for fatally shooting Rayshard Brooks last week kicked the 27-year-old man after he fell to the ground, Fulton County's district attorney said.
DA Paul Howard announced 11 charges against Garrett Rolfe, who fired three shots at Brooks, two of which hit Brooks in the back and another that hit a car with three people inside.
After Rolfe shot Brooks, he failed to give timely first aid, exclaimed, &quot;I got him,&quot; and kicked Brooks as he struggled for his life, Howard said.
Asked by a reporter about new details revealed by the district attorney, Tomika Miller, Brooks' widow, began to cry and said, &quot;I was very hurt. ... I felt everything that he felt just by hearing what he went through. And it hurt. It hurt really bad.&quot;
A law firm representing Rolfe said he reacted after he thought he &quot;heard a gunshot and saw a flash in front of him.&quot;
&quot;Fearing for his safety, and the safety of the civilians around him, Officer Rolfe dropped his taser and fired his service weapon at the only portion of Mr. Brooks that presented to him -- Mr. Brooks' back,&quot; a statement released by the LoRusso Law Firm says.
Attorneys for Rolfe said their client immediately called for emergency medical services and began rendering aid to Brooks.
The killing Friday night came amid nationwide protests calling for an end to racism and police violence against black people. Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields stepped down from her position in the wake of the killing.
Another demonstration was taking place Wednesday at the Wendy's where Brooks was shot, with dozens of protesters gathered and some blocking the road.
Devin Brosnan, the other officer at the shooting, faces an aggravated assault charge for standing on Brooks in the parking lot.
The demeanor after the shooting &quot;did not reflect any fear or danger of Mr. Brooks, but reflected other kinds of emotions,&quot; Howard said.
Brosnan has agreed to be a state's witness, Howard said -- a fact disputed by one of the officer's attorneys.
&quot;Officer Brosnan has not agreed to testify,&quot; lawyer Don Samuel said in an email to CNN. &quot;He is absolutely not guilty of any crime and will not plead guilty and has not agreed to be a 'state's witness.'&quot;

   <media:description>Former national security adviser John Bolton claims President Donald Trump asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to help him win the 2020 US presidential election, according to an excerpt from his upcoming book published by the Wall Street Journal.
That encounter, according to Bolton, took place during a June 2019 meeting between the two leaders in Osaka, Japan, where &quot;Xi told Trump that the U.S.-China relationship was the most important in the world&quot; and said that &quot;some (unnamed) American political figures were making erroneous judgments by calling for a new cold war with China.&quot;
&quot;Whether Xi meant to finger the Democrats or some of us sitting on the US side of the table, I don't know, but Trump immediately assumed that Xi meant the Democrats. Trump said approvingly that there was great hostility to China among the Democrats,&quot; Bolton writes in the WSJ.
&quot;Trump then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China's economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win. He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome,&quot; he adds.

   <media:description>Vice President Mike Pence, the leader of the administration's coronavirus task force, is publicly painting a rosy picture of the pandemic through his words and actions amid President Donald Trump's push to reopen the country and resume campaigning.

But despite the administration's efforts to declare the pandemic over, 18 states are currently experiencing an increase in cases. And health officials have implored Americans to heed task force guidelines -- including wearing a mask and social distancing -- to slow the spread, and a key model used by the White House is now projecting more than 200,000 deaths by October.

   <media:description>They fought with fists, stones, and bamboo poles with nails in them, in a bloody brawl that left around two dozen people dead.

More details are emerging about a clash late Monday night along a disputed border between India and China high in the Himalayas, which has ratcheted up tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbors and left officials on both sides scrambling to deescalate.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded to the violent face-off, in which at least 20 Indian soldiers died and many more were injured, saying that India does not &quot;instigate&quot; and will not compromise on &quot;integrity and sovereignty.&quot;

China also suffered casualties in the confrontation, the Indian army said, though neither side has released any figures.
