   <media:description>Lebanon is now preparing for a four-day nationwide shutdown, only a week after easing some of its coronavirus restrictions.
Government ministers made the decision after the number of new daily cases rose to its highest level in more than a month.
That has prompted concerns about a second wave of infection.

   <media:description>With much of the United States practising self-quarantine measures in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, it is no longer business as usual. Just about everyone is rethinking their day-to-day work routine as they adjust to a new normal. That includes political campaigns as the clock ticks down to November’s US presidential election. 

US President Donald Trump has dismissed the notion that the election is a referendum on his handling of the virus, despite recent revelations that the virus has crept into the White House. The president’s valet, a military member who assists the president with personal tasks, tested positive last week. Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, also tested positive. Miller is the wife of senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller. 

News of the outbreak reaching the White House forced officials to ramp up testing and contact tracing, a move that provided fodder to the president's foes. Democratic candidate Joe Biden claims President Trump’s response to the pandemic highlights a serious lack of leadership. 

&quot;Instead of unifying the country to accelerate our public health response and get economic relief to those who need it, President Trump is reverting to a familiar strategy of deflecting blame and dividing Americans,&quot; Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Monday.

On this episode of The Stream, we look at the impact the pandemic is having on the race for White House and ask how the candidates’ campaigns are adapting.

   <media:description>The coronavirus pandemic is putting enormous strain on health systems worldwide.
In some countries that means resources are being diverted from other treatments.
Patients with illnesses such as HIV, tuberculosis or malaria risk having their treatment interrupted.
A joint study by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS says deaths from HIV-related illnesses could double in Sub-Sahara Africa if therapies are disrupted for six months.
What should be done to ensure health services don't neglect other critical diseases?

   <media:description>Round upon round of temperature checks at building entrances. Nervous glances between passengers on the reawakening subway trains. And a working day that bans close contact with colleagues. Millions of people across China are re-adjusting to public life after the lifting of weeks-long lockdowns and other restrictions that sought to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Governments in Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan – the latter the one-time epicentre of what has now mushroomed into a coronavirus pandemic – are among those trying to walk a line between letting people resume a semblance of regular life while minimising the risk of future outbreaks. Yet the ‘new normal’ in China is very different to life before lockdown. Apart from having to follow rules and regulations imposed by local authorities, people are also making major changes to their personal lives, from taking different commutes to working different hours. Many are cutting their daily outgoings, and some are even considering moving from expensive megacities to places where their money will stretch further.

Chinese authorities are placing big data at the heart of efforts to keep coronavirus at bay, with a QR code-based 'traffic light' system tracking people’s movements and health. But critics say that coronavirus is being used as a pretext for increased surveillance of the entire population well into the future. Governments around the world are closely watching China’s strategy to combat coronavirus, amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington over US President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about the origin of the coronavirus.

We'll look at how people in China are adapting to daily life after coronavirus upended what came before. Join the conversation.

   <media:description>African leaders are asking what China can do for them as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to destroy economies and wipe out about 20 million jobs.
Beijing is both the top trading partner and top lender on the continent.

   <media:description>&quot;The bombings were getting closer and closer,&quot; says Dr Nasser Alzhouri.

As the war in Syria raged, the Alzhouri family home burned down. Alzhouri and his son, Suliman, set off for Lebanon. The only thing Alzhouri took with him was his degree certificate.

Unbeknown to his father, Suliman had snuck back into their house to rescue his university ID card. The values that his father had instilled in him, that education is everything, had compelled him to return.

Since then, Suliman has worked as a teacher in Lebanon's Tal Abbas refugee camp, housing many refugees fleeing Syria's war.

There are more than one million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, about 80 percent of whom are women and children.

&quot;I'm so proud of him,&quot; Alzhouri tells of Suliman. &quot;Especially in this difficult period our children are living in. He brings back smiles to their faces.&quot;

More than 465,000 people have been killed in the Syrian war and over one million have been wounded. Some 12 million people - over half the country's population - have been displaced.

&quot;I remember I was in the third grade,&quot; a student says, recalling her life before the war. &quot;All the children were happy. I remember the beautiful time when dad was still with us.&quot; But she has managed to find hope.

&quot;The school is my second home,&quot; she says, smiling. &quot;It gives me more than I give to it. I would be so happy to go back home (to Syria). I'd go home today. Why wait for tomorrow?&quot;

Despite their young age and all they've been through, many of Suliman's students wish to return one day and rebuild their country.

&quot;I want to be a teacher,&quot; says one child.

''I want to be a doctor, to heal the sick,&quot; adds another.

&quot;Study. Just study,&quot; a classmate says.

Alzhouri knows too well how the war has affected an entire generation of children. &quot;They can't get an education. This is a tragedy. There's another generation that hasn't even begun to study. They've never been in school. We're in this situation for five years; whole generations are lost.&quot;

He has taught his son to help others.

&quot;We're the children of Syria,&quot; says Suliman. &quot;Syria needs me and needs them. My work is for the love of homeland.&quot;

   <media:description>Qatari health officials have said the rate of new infections in the country has been easing off after more than a month of rising 
numbers.
Scientists are now trying to understand infections in the country and how restrictions of movement can safely be relaxed.

With more than 23,000 cases recorded to date, Qatar has a very high per-capita infection rate, but one of the lowest mortality rates in the world, with 14 deaths.

   <media:description>The Australian seafood industry, reeling from disrupted supply chains and coronavirus lockdowns, is expected to fall in value by at least $400m this year. 
That has forced producers to rethink the way they get their food onto people's plates, but the challenges ahead are daunting. 

Al Jazeera’s Nicola Gage reports from Sydney, Australia.
