   <media:description>The Book of Esther begins with the Queen of King Ahasuerus—Vashti—snubbing the king's request to meet with her. Naturally, being a rather unstable fellow, Ahasuerus fires-slash-divorces her. Now he needs to pick a new queen and eventually manages to select Esther—a comely, young (secretly Jewish) woman who is a part of his harem.
