But there were no women at all running for city attorney or controller, or for several of the City Council offices. From July 1, when the all-male victors took office, to Aug. 2, when they were joined by new Councilwoman Nury Martinez, Los Angeles City Hall had no elected women in office for the first time in decades.

None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
