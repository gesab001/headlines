This week, Bret sits down with political editor for National Journal Josh Kraushaar, USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page and Democratic strategist and syndicated Talk Radio host Leslie Marshall to discuss Joe Biden's pick of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate. The panel discusses the strengths and weaknesses of Harris as Biden's vice president, how a Biden-Harris ticket could change the 2020 presidential race, what issues President Trump will focus on as the campaigns move closer to the conventions and what Biden's choice means for the ideological direction of the Democratic Party.
