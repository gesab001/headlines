   <media:description>The church of Laodicea is described as being rich and in need of nothing, but Jesus declared it to be miserable, poor, blind and naked. This description applied not only to ancient Laodicea, but it was a prophecy of God’s last-day church. In this first episode, we take a closer look at the Laodicean condition and how it applies to the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

   <media:description>In 2 Timothy 4:3 the apostle Paul wrote that a time would come when people would no longer endure sound doctrine. That time has come. True theology has been replaced with false theology, often termed New Theology. In this episode, we take a look at what this New Theology is, how it was brought into the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and its ramifications.

   <media:description>Once the New Theology was accepted in the 1950’s, it did not take long for the central doctrine of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to be challenged. That doctrine is the investigative judgment. At the beginning of the 20th century, men like A. F. Ballenger and D. M. Canright tried to destroy this central doctrine, but they failed. In the 1980’s, Desmond Ford tried, but he also did not succeed. In this episode, we reveal how Satan has changed tactics and is trying to undermine the investigative judgment through a more subtle attack.

   <media:description>To a large degree, New Theology was held in check when God’s prophet, Ellen White, was alive to expose it. But since her death, Satan has inspired men to rise up in opposition to her writings. When the prophet of God is silenced, when the warnings, reproofs and counsel are made of none effect, then Satan can bring false theology into the church. And this is just what has happened. In this episode, we reveal how Ellen White is being relegated to devotional material, while scholars tear apart many of the doctrines that have made the Seventh-day Adventist Church what it is.

   <media:description>Ellen White predicted that once her writings were made of none effect, people would lose faith in the Bible. And this is just what has happened. Many scholars today now deny the authority of the Bible under the pretense of higher criticism. The authority of the Bible has been superseded by science and culture. In Part I of this subject, we look at how the creation account in the book of Genesis is being undermined in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

   <media:description>Having undermined the creation account in the book of Genesis, as seen in the previous episode, higher critics are now determined to destroy the marriage institution. This began subtly when the Seventh-day Adventist Church denied the Bible’s counsel regarding gender roles and ordained women as elders back in the 1970’s. Now there is a large movement within the church to disregard the Bible’s authority and ordain women as pastors. The downward step in apostasy will not end there. Based on similar arguments, higher critics are now advocating the acceptance of homosexuality, a sin that God considers an abomination.

   <media:description>We are living in the last days of this earth’s history, when Satan is gathering his church into a worldwide ecumenical body. The Seventh-day Adventist Church claims it has not officially joined any ecumenical body, but does that mean it is not involved in ecumenism? In this episode, we reveal how the church is, in fact, involved with ecumenism, even if it has not joined organizations like the World Council of Churches.

   <media:description>Ellen White warned that false music would be introduced into our churches just prior to the close of probation. That time has come. In an effort to make church attractive and for church growth, many Seventh-day Adventist churches have adopted Satan’s music. But what does God think about these worship services?

   <media:description>At the beginning of the 20th century, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was threatened by the alpha of deadly heresies when Dr. John Harvey Kellogg began teaching pantheism at the heart of the work. That crisis was met, but Ellen White predicted that the church would face a similar crisis, which she termed the omega. Today, that time has come. Through panentheism, spiritual formation, discipleship and the acceptance of Eastern mystical practices, spiritualism has infiltrated the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

   <media:description>Under the guidance of God, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was instructed to establish health and educational institutions to help spread the three angels’ messages. In this episode, we will see that many Seventh-day Adventist hospitals no longer fulfill that purpose. Have they also been affected by spiritualism?

   <media:description>Satan knows that if he can gain the hearts and minds of Seventh-day Adventist children, in time he can gain control of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This is why he has attacked its educational institutions from the time they were established. Seventh-day Adventist schools are supposed to be safe places where children can be educated to know and love God; but tragically, many teachers lead their students to love the world. In this episode, we show how Satan is winning the affections of Seventh-day Adventist students.

   <media:description>Since Ted Wilson was elected as the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference president, there has been much talk among the church’s leaders and members about revival and reformation. Yet sadly, very little has been said about what we are to reform from. In Josiah’s day, the reformation was achieved when all traces of sin were removed from the land. This is not happening today. Instead, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is going deeper into apostasy. What will it take to achieve a true revival and reformation? What will it take for the church to be ready for the outpouring of the latter rain?
