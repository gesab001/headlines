Night two of the Republican National Convention continued to push the GOP's argument against Democratic leadership while highlighting President Trump's accomplishments in office. First Lady Melania Trump also took center stage in front of a small audience in the Rose Garden discussing the American dream. FOX News National Correspondent Jared Halpern and FOX News Radio's Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar speak with Trump Campaign Director of Strategic Communications Marc Lotter about the RNC's &quot;Land of Opportunity&quot; theme and the controversy over President Trump's pardon and naturalization ceremony.

The Trump administration recently granted emergency authorization of convalescent plasma to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But there have been questions about the effectiveness of the treatment and whether or not the decision was made based on politics. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and a recovering COVID-19 patient, who recently received blood plasma, discuss the treatment and whether it should have been approved for widespread use.

Plus, commentary by Fox News Correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera.
