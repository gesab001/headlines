Following a GOP lunch on Tuesday, Senator Rand Paul slammed his fellow Republican colleagues on their spending proposals for the next coronavirus relief package. The Kentucky Senator joins today’s “Rundown” to discuss why he thinks increased spending on the stimulus package is not going to help, what he thinks should happen to get the country going again and why he believes New York Governor Andrew Cuomo should be impeached.

President Trump says if mayors and governors can't stop violence in their own cities, he will. So far he has sent Federal Homeland Security officers to Portland, Oregon. Fox's senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses this debate and whether or not a governor can mandate masks or the return of teachers to school.

Plus, commentary by Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy.

The FOX News Rundown is a news-based daily morning podcast. Each morning, Jacqui Heinrich, Dave Anthony, Lisa Brady, Jessica Rosenthal and Chris Foster take a deep dive into the major and controversial stories of the day, tapping into the massive reporting resources of FOX News to provide a full picture of the news. You'll hear a contrast of perspectives you may not hear elsewhere while going far beyond the basic headlines. Each day The FOX News Rundown features insight from top newsmakers, along with FOX News reporters and contributors, plus a daily commentary on a significant issue of the day. Check us out each morning.
