A desperate dog swimming in circles and near drowning with exhaustion; a dog stuck upside down in a narrow passageway; a young bull who would have been stuck until death after falling in a well, and other extreme disasters for street animals who could not survive without the help of human beings. 

Again and again, it's the neighbors who waste no time in calling our ambulance, helping lift animals to safety and lifting our hearts. Your heart will race just watching these astounding rescues.</media:description>

Hiding in pain and wailing when touched, this dog had been hit by a car, her hind leg fractured and partially degloved; her front leg sliced deeply at the top. But as soon as she understood she was safe in the arms of her rescuer, this girl stopped howling and wagged her tail. Unbelievable! 

And when we eased her pain with medication, wound dressing, splint and surgery on her forearm wound, she gave us the most beautiful reward: non-stop smiles filled with love throughout the coming weeks of her healing. 

Bessie's one of the precious souls who lives life like a song of gratitude, to the air, the earth; to her animal friends, to us, and to you.</media:description>

Neighbors spotted a beautiful dog laying by a rod in a construction site. When they came closer they saw to their horror that the rod had pierced through her thigh and she had impaled her. She couldn't get free no matter how she struggled. They called Animal Aid to the rescue, and we quickly arranged for workers to come with an electric metal saw. 

The terrified dog had to endure terrifying sounds of the saw against the metal, but we covered comforted her while the rod was cut and we were able to free her. 

Her wound was serious but because no bones had broken, we were able to clean, bandage and protect her with antibiotics. After her ordeal, she needed extra love to find the courage she would need to heal. 

And after a month of daily wound dressings and many cuddles, meet Shylee now!</media:description>

Stumbling and circling, this beautiful puppy's brain was injured after his head was hit by a passing car. His tender-hearted neighbors saw his extreme disorientation and called us to the rescue. 

His breathing was distressed and rapid and we worried that he might be bleeding internally. The first job was to stabilize his breathing; we gave him oxygen and medicine to reduce swelling. Regaining his balance and orientation would take weeks. We are so grateful that his brain damage isn't permanent but his adorable charm sure is. 

Meet Shabi now, one of the world's TRUE angels.</media:description>

This sweetheart was overcome with fear after being hit by a car. His lower canine tooth was dislodged and bled profusely and he couldn't stand. Although he had no broken bones, it took several days before he had the strength to stand on his own. 

His most aching pain, however, was his broken tooth, and the day after he was admitted we popped him in and out of surgery to extract it. This little guy--we named him Rana--was so emotional that he wouldn't eat until he was cuddled and reassured. 

Rana was neutered as soon as he was strong enough, and now he's as good as new. If courage is measured by overcoming fear, Rana proved to be a very brave little boy.</media:description>

   <media:description>The vehicle must have slammed into this beautiful bull at high speed. 

A huge chunk of flesh was simply missing as blood and gnarled tissue slipped along his ribs. Several passing motorists called us immediately after it happened, and we rushed to the site to find one of the most gentle beings we have ever met. 

From his first painful wound dressing until now, fully healed, Rollie did everything he could to make his difficult medical treatments as easy as possible. And when he healed, he set about nurturing the babies. 

Meet this giant love--Rollie--today.

   <media:description>The young puppy lay unconscious after being attacked by an animal. Worried neighbors had applied antibiotic cream while waiting for our ambulance to arrive. Completely collapsed, this puppy was close to death. 

We immediately gave him a saline drip, anti-inflammatory medicine, and antibiotics, and in the morning we thoroughly cleaned and bandaged his wound. 

At first, he was too weak and exhausted to communicate with his caregivers. But when he started to awaken from his coma, his little tail wag told us we had reason to hope he could survive. 

Meet beautiful Cub now! You can make tails wag.

   <media:description>We found Tigger lying in a cocoon of pain, curled up, hardly able to open his eyes for pain caused by mange. 

He could barely move. Every inch of him burned with scalding pain. Mange ravaged him, caused scabs, open wounds, and made him wince. Pain disoriented and consumed his imagination.

We treated him with an anti-parasite injection, many medicated baths, food and comfort. And when his mange was gone, he replaced every aching moment with nonstop JOY. Meet striped tiger-boyTigger today!

   <media:description>This desperate boy looked impossible to save. His skull appeared more &quot;incomplete&quot; than wounded. Maggots had burrowed into his head, and it now looked like a basin with exposed bone at the bottom. When maggots proliferate like this, they can do enormous damage within just hours. His survival was doubtful. He wandered in circles. But something in his overall body condition gave us a glimmer of hope. 

We learned that Alfie was one of the souls on earth with an enormous capacity to give and receive love. Without this unique gift, even with vigilant medical treatment, he probably couldn't have survived. But Alfie--well, Alfie's someone special.

Meet him now, and stretch your understanding of what's possible for precious souls.

   <media:description>Street puppy Barnaby was probably innocently playing when a passing vehicle hit his head.
He bled from his mouth and nose, and seemed disoriented. We suspected head injury and hurried him to our hospital, but were relieved to find him alert and cognitively stable. But we soon realized that he had a hairline jaw fracture. Puppies this young have soft bones that knit together rapidly, so we did not wire his jaw, and were delighted that with pain medicine to ease the swelling, Barnaby ate like a champ.

We kept him quiet and comforted for 15 days, and as he grew stronger, we could see how eager he was to go back to his parents and siblings. This injury healed well, but without pain medicine, soft food and loving care, Barnaby might have died without eating again.

Meet him now, big and strong. Help injured sweethearts heal.

   <media:description>An animal lover from outside of Udaipur saw a dog with a wire wrapped around and embedded in his neck and called us to rescue him. This is one of the deepest and most disturbing wounds we've ever seen. To catch him, we were able to lure him into a portable kennel, and hurried him to our hospital. 

The damage to his neck was horrendous. When we cut the wire off we were heartbroken to find that this wound was even worse than we'd suspected--maggots had burrowed into the deepest parts of the long gash. We immediately began treating the wound, without knowing if we'd found him in time to save his life. 

And the hurt to his trust ran even deeper. From the depths of despair, watch Bounce rise high. Help us bring back an animal's ability to love.

   <media:description>This teenager puppy's skin was partly degloved after probably being snagged by a passing vehicle. Because it covered a huge area on her shoulders, the pain must have been excruciating, and infection would be a grave danger. We hurried her to our hospital and were relieved that our surgeon saw there was enough skin at the margins to surgically repair the wound. This shy young girl emerged from her ordeal needing extra snuggles while her massive laceration became a tiny scar.

   <media:description>This beautiful boy was hit by a passing vehicle and his neck and spine were injured. His limbs were stiff and could not bear weight. Our protocol for spine injury is pain treatment, bed rest, good food, and gradual physiotherapy that begins with caressing and love. But with spine injuries, mobility is not guaranteed. 

We were heartbroken that after a month of treatment, this sweetheart still couldn't stand. Our hopes faded. But Colby had hidden strength, and he just needed a little more time. 

Meet Colby, the champion, now! Love awakens hidden strength.

   <media:description>Fragile and collapsed, this kitten was dying when she was found laying wet in the road. She wasn't bleeding; her tiny body was intact, but she had seemed to suffer a terrible trauma--maybe she fell, was rolled by a passing vehicle--we just have no idea. 

But we ever so gently hurried her to our hospital, examined her thoroughly, found no external injuries but treated her for pain, and gave her a safe, clean little kennel to rest in. We would have to wait to see if there was internal damage that might take her life. But our hearts leapt to see that within minutes her ears pricked forward and her eyes opened as she surveyed her surroundings. Where am I? she seemed to ask. Her curiosity was a sign that her life force was not lost. 

Watch what happens to beautiful little Horrera in the days to come!

   <media:description>Neighbors who feed street dogs found one of the puppies in their area with a deep forearm wound. Little Jazzy was in so much pain that he just lay still on the side while his siblings and parents carried on merrily. We hurried him to the hospital for treatment, and after his very first wound flushing and bandaging, this little snippet started healing immediately. 

He was accustomed to being touched and treating him was always a cheerful event. Within two weeks of daily flushing and fresh bandaging, Jazzy had healed so rapidly that we were able to return him to his furry family, where our Street Treatment Team visited him every alternate day until he was fully healed.

100% sweet deserves 100% healing. Please donate: https://www.animalaidunlimited.org/donate</media:description>
