   <media:description>In just over one month US President Donald Trump will exit the White House and president-elect Joe Biden will move in and begin to lead the country. 

The last four years, and the rancorous election that followed, have left behind a deeply divided people. The incoming president has said he intends to heal racial division and halt the relentless march of coronavirus in the worst affected country in the world.  

Biden has repeatedly insisted his government will be representative and reflect the nation's diversity. A number of his cabinet appointments have gone to officials from minority backgrounds to the applause of supporters. Critics on the left, though, say his transition team is focusing on the diversity of the selections to deflect criticism of the appointee's political records.

The first 100 days of a US president's term are generally seen as a symbolic benchmark and Biden says the first priority of his administration will be tackling the pandemic. He has already unveiled a three-point plan he says will immediately be put into action: distribute 100 million vaccines, introduce a national mask mandate and get children back to school safely. 

As he sets about tackling the pandemic - as well as the economy, racial justice, climate, immigration reform and foreign policy - he will have to work across the aisle with a potentially hostile Republican party and fend off discord between the centrist and progressive wings of the Democratic party.

On this episode of The Stream, we’ll look at the many challenges that lie ahead for Biden and ask what’s achievable, and what may not be, in his first 100 days.

   <media:description>A number of UNESCO World Heritage sites are under threat.  
The special status often catapults remote locations to international fame, but it can also be taken away. 
Al Jazeera looks at challenges these sites face and why the designation matters. 

In the second of our five-part series, Al Jazeera’s Andy Gallacher reports from Florida’s Everglades National Park, a site environmentalists say is at a critical juncture.

Sviatlana Tikhanovskaya received the award in Strasbourg.
Belarus has been in a political crisis since a controversial presidential election in August.
Incumbent Alexander Lukashenko claimed to have won with a landslide, but the opposition regards Tikhanovskaya as the real winner.

   <media:description>Boko Haram outraged much of the world in 2014 when it abducted schoolgirls in Chibok.
A few years after a military operation was launched against the armed group, it has claimed responsibility for a similar attack.
Hundreds of schoolboys were kidnapped, this time in the northwest. 
The attack in Katsina state was initially blamed on bandit groups that have carried out kidnaps for ransom in the area.
Hundreds of students are missing while others escaped.
Boko Haram says it had targeted the school to fulfil a long-held aim of stopping western education.
Can this group be defeated?

One camp may need to be closed because it has not been made safe for winter, even though international funding is available.

   <media:description>As one of a few female mental health professionals in Syria’s Idlib province, Abeer al-Faris has her work cut out for her. 
 
Every day, she gets up at the crack of dawn to manage the Dar al-Amal Education Village, an independent care centre for widows and orphans of war. 
 
The Village is one of a few sanctuaries in Atmeh, a small but growing town in northern Idlib, where residents receive free healthcare, education and counseling.
 
But managing a mental health facility in a warzone, as Abeer explains, is not for the faint hearted. As well as a lack of funding, resources and skilled personnel, Abeer also has to battle conservative opinions on her work.
 
“The biggest difficulty has been getting around without a male guardian,” she says, “I’ve tried to persuade them that there’s no religious objection for women to work but it’s hard for society to accept this view.”
 
After years of civil war in Syria, Idlib is the last remaining rebel-held territory in the country. 
 
Ongoing violence throughout 2020, has resulted in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing their homes to IDP camps in northern Idlib, compounding the already disastrous humanitarian situation. And residents are facing a critical lack of access to quality primary health care – especially mental health services.
 
According to The World Health organisation, one in thirty people suffer from severe mental health conditions. While one in five have ‘mild to moderate’ conditions, such as depression.
 
“Behind each of these doors, there’s a story of tragedy,” Abeer admits, “But it’s also a story of hope,” she says, smiling.

   <media:description>In European cities, young people of Arab descent often see themselves as socially, economically and culturally excluded from their immediate environment. In some cases, they are also vulnerable to radicalisation.

In Belgium, the densely populated Brussels suburb of Molenbeek is home to 100,000 residents, many of them first and second-generation immigrants. It gained notoriety in 2015 as the home of some of the Bataclan attackers in Paris. In Sweden, Muslims in the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby say that authorities have abandoned them, leaving them vulnerable to far-right racist attacks, while police dismiss suggestions that they have failed to protect immigrants. And in Denmark, in the Copenhagen suburb of Norrebro, communities speak of a social hierarchy that places Danes at the top of the socioeconomic ladder and Arabs at the bottom.

In The Other Face Of Europe, we visit these three cities to get an insight into the issues and to hear directly from those living with it every day: radicalised young people, criminal gang members, fighters returning from Syria and their families, as well as politicians, experts, psychologists, social workers and security officers. What is at the root of youth radicalisation in these communities? And how do significant influences at play - such as right-wing anti-immigrant politics, negative media coverage and social deprivation in the poor suburbs of relatively prosperous cities - deepen these tensions?</media:description>

   <media:description>European countries are facing tough choices in their fight against the coronavirus, trying to decide how to implement restrictions. 
Cases are surging ahead of the end-of-year holiday season, with fears that increased travel could accelerate the spread. 
With Germany and the Netherlands entering national lockdowns, businesses are expecting to be hit hard. 
The past 24 hours also brought new hope that vaccines could be administered in some countries before the end of the year.

   <media:description>The UN Security Council is expected to approve two new envoys to lead peace efforts in two long-term conflicts in the Middle East.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is putting forward Nickolay Mladenov as his special Libya envoy, while Tor Wennesland will be the UN mediator between Israel and the Palestinians.
Wennesland will focus on bringing Palestinians and Israelis back to the negotiating table and Mladenov on holding elections in Libya.
