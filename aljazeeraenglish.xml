   <media:description>When the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, newly independent states emerged.

These new borders meant that all of a sudden people found themselves on the wrong side - foreigners in a country they called their home, but were unable to prove or formally claim as such.

The United Nations refugee agency estimates that at least 280 million people lost their citizenship during the formation of post-Soviet republics, including in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.

Nearly 30 years later, thousands across the region live without any legal trace - many of them having inherited their statelessness from their parents.

Azizbek Ashurov is a Kyrgyz lawyer, and founder of the Ferghana Lawyers Without Borders association. He has spent more than a decade fighting for the rights of thousands of stateless people in his country.

To access those in need, Ashurov and his team first had to figure out how many people lacked legal identity, and find ways to help them. With an estimated two-thirds of Kyrgyzstan's six million people living in rural areas, the team spent much of their time in the hills and villages of the Ferghana valley which spreads across parts of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

The work has had an effect.

The NGO has helped more than 10,000 stateless people in Kyrgyzstan gain citizenship, and some 2,000 children now have access to education, health and a more promising future.

Kyrgyzstan is now a leading example of how statelessness can be eradicated - there are no more known cases of people living there without a legal identity.

Talk to Al Jazeera travelled to Kyrgyzstan to meet Ashurov and some of the people he has helped.

   <media:description>Donald Trump is cutting US ties with the World Health Organization (WHO), claiming it is being influenced by Beijing.
At a news conference, the president stepped up his anti-Chinese rhetoric, announcing plans to strip Hong Kong of its special status with the US, in response to new security law.

   <media:description>A policeman has been charged with murder and the National Guard are on the streets of the United States city of Minneapolis.
But across the country, anger over the death of George Floyd, during his arrest on Monday, shows little sign of easing.
A curfew has been declared by the city's mayor after three nights of protests. Stores have been looted and burned.
On Thursday night a police station, where the accused officer worked, was set alight.
 
Al Jazeera’s John Hendren reports on a day of dramatic developments.

   <media:description>A Washington Post investigation shows Black people in the US are being shot and killed by police at more than twice the rate of white people.
George Floyd's death is just the latest incident this year. 
In March, Breonna Taylor was shot eight times by police as she lay in bed. 
Plain-clothes officers entered her Kentucky home in the middle of the night without warning. 
It was part of a drugs investigation - but nothing was found in the apartment. 
This month a Sudanese-American man, Yassin Mohamed, was shot dead in Georgia after several encounters with police. 
Advocates say he may have been suffering from mental health problems. 
Also in Georgia, police are accused of delaying the investigation into the February killing of jogger Ahmaud Arbery because one of the suspects has links to law enforcement.
Courtney Radsch, advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, discusses the issue with Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>When COVID-19 started to spread around the world, aid workers warned of disaster for Africa.
Health systems are weak and poorly funded in many places, and crowded cities making social distancing impossible.
But African countries appear to be managing.
Senegal and Ghana are among countries praised for their approach to tackle the disease.
The number of infections and deaths in Africa is much lower than the US, Europe, and Latin America.
But scientists say the figures are misleading because of low testing rates.
So are we getting a full picture of the situation?

   <media:description>India's government is being accused of using the coronavirus emergency to exploit millions of workers.
After two months of lockdown, some of India’s biggest states have suspended most labour laws in a bid to restart the economy.
Trade unions say changes to working hours, wages and health and safety standards weaken workers' rights at a time they cannot protest. 
Al Jazeera's Elizabeth Puranam reports from New Delhi.

   <media:description>US President Donald Trump has made his frustration with Twitter official.
He has signed an executive order aimed at stripping social media platforms of some legal protections, especially if they remove or amend content on their sites. 
It comes after two of the president's tweets were labelled &quot;misleading&quot;.

   <media:description>Ethnic minorities make up less than 20 percent of the British population but the outsized impact of coronavirus on their communities is startling. 
 
According to the UK’s Office for National Statistics black people are four times more likely to die from COVID-19 than white people. Ethnic Bangladeshi and Pakistani men are 1.8 times more likely to have a COVID-19-related death than white males. And ethnic minority women are 1.6 times more likely to die from the virus.
 
The impact on frontline workers is similarly stark. Almost 100 black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) medical staff are now known to have died from COVID-19. 
 
Under growing political pressure, the British government and National Health Service have launched a public health inquiry with initial findings due at the end of May. The opposition Labour party has begun an independent investigation of its own. 
 
Research available so far suggests several factors are driving the high infection rates and death toll in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups - bigger households, higher rates of comorbidities such as diabetes and heart disease, large numbers of BAME workers in frontline services and a lack of information in community languages.
 
Some scientists are examining whether a genetic component, alongside the other risk factors, may also predispose BAME populations to complications from COVID-19.
 
In this episode of The Stream, we look into the numbers and meet BAME community members to ask why the pandemic is having such a devastating impact on them.
