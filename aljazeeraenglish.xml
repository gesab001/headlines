   <media:description>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there's been a global race to find a vaccine. 
But scientists are worried some countries may be rushing the process and compromising safety. 
Earlier this week, Russian president Vladimir Putin said his country has approved the world's first coronavirus vaccine. 
But Scientists in Russia and abroad are sceptical about its effectiveness.
They say offering it to the public before the important final stage of testing, could pose serious problems. 
So, were Russian scientists pressured to cut corners? 
And is there significance to the timing of the announcement?

   <media:description>At least three people have died in southern India's Bengaluru city after protesters clashed with police over a provocative social media post about the Prophet Muhammad, police have told Reuters news agency.
The Facebook post offensive to Muslims sparked protests in India's tech hub on Tuesday night in which a police station was attacked, and a politician's house and vehicles were torched.
&quot;The situation is under control,&quot; Bengaluru City Police said on Twitter, adding that police fired live ammunition to disperse the crowd after using tear gas and batons.
&quot;Despite elders of the community trying to pacify the crowd, the mob burnt vehicles on the road, they attacked the police station,&quot; Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said.
Al Jazeera's Elizabeth Puranam reports.

   <media:description>US presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's selection of Senator Kamala Harris gives him a running mate who can appeal to African American voters who are core to Biden's base of support and serve as a fierce critic of President Donald Trump's record in office.
A former top state prosecutor in California, Senator Harris brings a law-and-order career record that will help Biden steer a tricky, centrist line between Black Lives Matter protesters and white Americans who worry about attacks on police funding.
At the same time, picking a woman who competed with Biden during the presidential primaries and attacked him memorably on race during a debate, shows Biden asserting a degree of self-confidence that he can forge a cooperative, working relationship with her, political analysts told Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>Schools throughout the United States are starting to reopen.
And despite rising coronavirus cases, many educators are bringing children back to the classroom rather than using online technology. 
That choice, as Al Jazeera's Patty Culhane reports, has become a major political battle between the White House and the states, and the students are caught in the middle.

   <media:description>The United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has condemned the violent crackdown by the Belarusian government on protesters after three nights of unrest.
Police have arrested more than 6,000 people during the protests that followed Sunday's disputed presidential election.
Lithuania, Latvia and Poland are offering to mediate, but say sanctions may come if that offer is not taken up.

   <media:description>A former head of Mexico's state oil company has implicated former President Enrique Pena Nieto and his then-Finance Minister Luis Videgaray in a corruption scandal.
The accusations are still unproven but have caused big ripples in a country where impunity is a significant problem.

   <media:description>UNESCO estimates that school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic have affected more than 320 million students across India. The move has exposed long-running structural imbalances between rural and urban populations, male and female and the rich and poor, creating a massive gap in learning. 

Earlier this month, the Ministry of Human Resource Development launched an “alternative” classroom calendar, which included lesson plans accessible via smartphone, social media, SMS, television and radio. But the latest data from India Cellular and Electronics Association estimates only 25 percent of people in rural India have access to a smartphone. And, while internet penetration is growing, only about 30 percent of the rural population has internet access. 

Girls are particularly badly affected. They face family constraints, physical safety threats and insufficient access to menstrual hygiene, all of which can force them out of the education system. 

In some cities, education department officials are distributing smartphones and tablets to facilitate e-learning in government schools but, to further fill the need, innovators are also helping students with access using pre-internet technology. ThinkZone is one such initiative and uses voice calling, SMS and radio partnerships to give rural students daily learning modules. 

In this episode of The Stream, we’ll take a look at the learning gap in India, ask what the solutions are and consider the impact on children locked out of the system.

   <media:description>As countries around the world grapple with COVID-19, economic downturn and social unrest, experts say ISIL is capitalising on current instability to gain more followers and build upon its presence in regions including West Africa and Southeast Asia. Some worry the potential for recruitment is even greater at a time when many more people are jobless and feeling distraught under lockdown. 

With governments focused on pandemic response, is enough being done to combat ISIL's ability to spread its ideology and carry out attacks? In this episode of The Stream, we'll discuss how the group is trying to use the coronavirus threat to its advantage.

   <media:description>Nearly five million children have been born in Syria since the civil war began, nine years ago. 
The conflict has had a devastating effect on their lives, with many forced to drop out of school to support their families.
Aid agencies warn Syria's deepening economic and currency crisis will push even more kids into child labour.

   <media:description>Some big US companies are pledging to hire tens of thousands of workers from low-income and minority communities in New York City.
They say the initiative, to be implemented over the next 10 years, is in response to Black Lives Matter protests. 
But activists have accused some of the companies involved of being drivers of racial inequality in the United States. 

Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi reports.

   <media:description>Latin America is seeing worrisome spikes in infections even in countries that had initially controlled the new coronavirus. Colombia on Tuesday passed 400,000 confirmed cases, becoming the country with the eighth highest total in the world.
The region is the current epicentre of the pandemic.
The economic effects of long lockdowns are also sparking protests.

Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti reports from Colombia's capital, Bogota.

   <media:description>Tanzania is enforcing a new crackdown on the media.   
Under a new law, coverage of the coronavirus pandemic will essentially be silenced.
And there are fears it will also prevent fair and balanced reporting on the presidential election later this year.
