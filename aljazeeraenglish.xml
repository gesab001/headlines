   <media:description>Some of India's popular monuments have reopened for the first time in more than three months, but its most famous - the Taj Mahal - and others in the city of Agra remain closed. 
The number of coronavirus cases in India has continued to rise, and the area around the Taj Mahal is under quarantine.
India has surpassed Russia as the third-worst affected country, with nearly 700,000 cases and 20,000 deaths. 
Al Jazeera's Elizabeth Puranam reports from New Delhi.

   <media:description>Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed’s work towards securing a peace deal with neighbouring Eritrea brought him to the attention of the world, and saw him awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. And he has won support at home for releasing political prisoners and trying to forge national unity. But just six months after Ethiopia’s first Oromo leader accepted the award in Oslo, the killing of a popular musician in Addis Ababa is fuelling a wave of both cross-communal and intra-ethnic unrest, amid unease over a postponed election.

Hachalu Hundessa, an Oromo protest singer, was shot dead in the Ethiopian capital on June 29. Police suspect a targeted killing. Thousands of people in the Oromia region took to the streets demanding answers, and scores of people were killed amid violence between gangs from different backgrounds. Jawar Mohammed and Bekele Gerba, two prominent Oromo opponents of Abiy, were arrested.

Politicians in opposition to Abiy’s Prosperity Party-led government were already critical of its declaration of a state of emergency in April due to the impact of coronavirus, as well as by parliament’s recent votes to delay elections due in August and allow Abiy to remain in office beyond his term. His opponents contend he is trying to hold on to power.

Abiy has long said that he wants to promote pan-Ethiopianism through his ‘medemer’ (‘coming together’) philosophy, and the recently-formed Prosperity Party brings together several parties representing Oromo, Afar and Amhara communities, among others. But the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which dominated a coalition government for years before Abiy took office, is absent. And historical differences over land and political power in Ethiopia persist.

With an election now on ice, Tigrayan leaders in the north vowing to forge ahead with their own vote, and support for Abiy’s government cooling in his Oromia heartland, does a crisis loom for Ethiopia and its prime minister?

   <media:description>The border between Australia's two most populous states is closing indefinitely as coronavirus infections soar on one side. 
Authorities in Victoria are scrambling to bring the spiking case numbers back down in the state, locking down residents and bringing in more social distancing measures. 
Australia has fared better than many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the outbreak is a clear example of how quickly the virus can return.

   <media:description>Libya's UN-recognised government has condemned air raids on a recaptured air base in the west of the country.
It says a “foreign air force” carried out the attack.
The loss of the facility in May was among a string of recent defeats for renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, pushing him out of large parts of western Libya.
Haftar launched an offensive to seize the capital, Tripoli, last year.

Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed reports from Tripoli.

   <media:description>The survivor of a brutal honour killing in India testifies against her parents in the murder trial of her lower-caste husband.

In March 2016, Kausalya and her husband Shankar were brutally attacked on a crowded street in southern India.

Shankar, who came from a lower Dalit caste, died of his injuries. Kausalya survived and accused her parents of orchestrating an honour killing.

Witness follows Kausalya as she fights for justice through the courts, testifying against her parents in a trial where they face the death penalty.

Kausalya's now-estranged grandparents and brother, Gautham, also await the verdict, desperately hoping Kausalya's mother and father will be released.

The unique access to both sides shows a family torn apart by a caste hierarchy that remains deeply-rooted in India's social fabric.

   <media:description>The coronavirus crisis has disrupted global food supply chains, leading to shortages in some countries. 
The World Bank warns 130 million people could be at risk of starvation.
But an increasingly popular urban farming system could provide a solution.

   <media:description>COVID-19 cases and deaths are surging along Colombia's Caribbean coast as the region becomes the epicentre of the pandemic in the country, with doctors warning many deaths are going unreported.
Intensive care units are now 80 percent full in Bogota. 
The national government bought new ventilators to increase availability but a lack of trained doctors means not all of them can be used at the same time. 

Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti reports from Bogota.

   <media:description>Iran is expressing frustration at attempts to save the 2015 nuclear deal.
It's triggered a mechanism to resolve issues with Britain, France and Germany.
The Iranian foreign minister sent a letter to European leaders on Friday - accusing them of not living up to their side of the agreement.
Javad Zarif says Tehran has now triggered the dispute mechanism of the agreement six times.
The Europeans, Russia and China have been trying to salvage the deal after the U.S. pulled out in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.
Since then, Tehran has been rolling back its commitments.
But with the U.S. determined to keep isolating Iran, is the agreement still worth saving?

   <media:description>As nations around the world struggle to flatten the coronavirus curve, some have been able to keep numbers of new infections down and health services running, allowing themselves to gradually open up. 
 
New Zealand:
In March the government decided to go for a full elimination strategy. 

At the time New Zealand had only 205 cases of Covid-19 and no deaths, but the government implemented one of the strictest lockdowns in the world - fully closing the country's borders to non-nationals, while only permitting residents to leave their homes for essential reasons. All returning nationals faced mandatory quarantine. While that has put isolation centers under stress, there have not been any new, locally acquired cases since the end of May. In June New Zealand lifted all domestic restrictions, except for the border closure. 

New Zealand has now pushed down the curve, although some residents fear global isolation. 
 
Vietnam:
At the start of the pandemic, an assumption of Vietnam’s extreme vulnerability to the coronavirus would not have been misplaced. It shares a long border with China, a key trading partner, and Vietnam's infrastructure and healthcare is limited. But as of today Vietnam has recorded only around 352 cases of Covid-19 and zero deaths among its population of 96 million. And the government expects the economy to grow by 5%. 
 
In January, Vietnamese authorities implemented drastic measures to thwart expected coronavirus outbreaks, months before other countries acted. The borders were closed, schools were shuttered, and robust health checks were undertaken in vulnerable places. Contract tracing and testing was rolled out for people not showing symptoms. This all went hand in hand with multimedia public service campaigns. 

We’ll discuss the keys to Vietnam’s success and also examine concerns that the fight against coronavirus has come at the expense of human rights and proper reporting. 
 
Iceland:
Iceland started with one of the highest infection rates in Europe - 513 cases per 100,000 people. But by March, while other countries were struggling to roll out accurate, widespread coronavirus tests, Iceland had the highest ratio of tests per capita in the world. A fact no doubt helped by its small population. 

Iceland's screening and contact tracing system has been so efficient that it now boasts one of the lowest virus death rates in the world: 3 per 100,000 people. 

We’ll be joined by Icelandic experts to discuss their testing and contract tracing strategy and how they worked with their citizens to crush the curve.

   <media:description>As the United States election approaches, a new dynamic is playing out. President Donald Trump is not just fending off attacks by members of the opposing party, but also from his own.

Some prominent Republicans have publicly stated they will vote for former Vice President Joe Biden and are working to help get him elected.

Al Jazeera's Patty Culhane has that story.
