Luke 15:8-10
‚Äú8 Or what woman, having ten valuable coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? 9And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the valuable coin that I had lost.' 10Likewise, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.‚Äù (Luke 15:8-10).

Luke 15:4-7
4 What man here, having a hundred sheep, and lost one of them, would not leave the 99 in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? 5 And when finds it, he lays it on his shoulders, delighted. 6 And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' 7 Just so, I say to you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who need no repentance.‚Äù (Luke 15:4-7).

Luke 7:41-43
41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. 45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. 47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. 48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

   <media:description>Matthew 8:5-13
5 When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. 6 ‚ÄúLord,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúmy servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.‚Äù
7 Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúShall I come and heal him?‚Äù
8 The centurion replied, ‚ÄúLord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‚ÄòGo,‚Äô and he goes; and that one, ‚ÄòCome,‚Äô and he comes. I say to my servant, ‚ÄòDo this,‚Äô and he does it.‚Äù
10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. 11 I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 12 But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äù
13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, ‚ÄúGo! Let it be done just as you believed it would.‚Äù And his servant was healed at that moment.

   <media:description>Title: Joseph's Reunion
The drought had stripped Canaan bare of crops, yet Egypt had vast storehouses of food. Jacob knew that unless he acted soon, his entire family would starve, so he sent ten of his sons to Pharaoh to buy provisions. They never imagined that there they would find not only food, but the brother they had long ago betrayed and given up for dead.

This is the second half of the classic story begun in Joseph in Egypt, reaffirming the care and love of God for his children.

Esther[a] is described in all versions[b] of the Book of Esther as the Jewish queen of a Persian king Ahasuerus. In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, Vashti, refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty. The king's chief adviser, Haman, is offended by Esther's cousin and guardian, Mordecai, and gets permission from the king to have all the Jews in the kingdom killed. Esther foils the plan, and wins permission from the king for the Jews to kill their enemies, and they do so. Her story provides a traditional background for Purim, which is celebrated on the date given in the story for when Haman's order was to go into effect, which is the same day that the Jews killed their enemies after the plan was reversed.

Because the text lacks any references to known events, some historians believe that the narrative of Esther is fictional, and the name Ahasuerus is used to refer to a fictionalized Xerxes I, in order to provide an aetiology for Purim. Some historians additionally argue that, because the Persian kings did not marry outside a handful of Persian noble families, it is unlikely that there was a Jewish queen Esther and that in any case the historical Xerxes's queen was Amestris.[2][3][f] That being said, many Jews believe the story to be a true historical event, especially Persian Jews who have a close relationship to Esther.</media:description>
