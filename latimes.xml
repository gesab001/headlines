After she spoke during a news conference outside LAPD Headquarters to announce lawsuits against the LAPD over its alleged targeted attacks against journalists and activists during anti-transgender and counter protests associated with Wi Spa, a Koreatown business with a trans-inclusive policy that gained notoriety when a customer filmed herself complaining about a trans woman in the women's area of the establishment, contact says. Justice X contends that LAPD officers ``illegally fired deadly projectiles at defenseless protesters, attacked innocent protesters with batons and other weapons and were harboring white supremacists in violation of constitutional rights.''

L.A. County is by far the biggest jurisdiction in the nation to require masks again. But with coronavirus cases rising across the nation largely because of the highly infectious Delta variant, officials elsewhere will be watching to see if the effort works.

The ceremony included Rams Owner/Chairman and SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park developer E. Stanley Kroenke, Chargers Owner/Chairman Dean Spanos and the City of Inglewood's Mayor James T. Butts. The stadium is the first football stadium to be built within Los Angeles in Nearly 100 years. "We are in the team business, and you can't get to a moment like today without a great team. I would like to thank the 17,000 people who have worked on this project over the past four years," said Rams Owner/Chairman Stan Kroenke. "During a period of unrest and change in many parts of the country, it's been our deepest privilege to work on a project this special with such a diverse workforce. Thank you for making our vision a reality." SoFi Stadium is the first indoor-outdoor stadium and seats approximately 70,000, expandable up to 100,000. SoFi Stadium is located at Hollywood Park, a near 300-acre sports and entertainment destination being developed by Kroenke in Inglewood and at 3.1 million square-foot SoFi Stadium is the largest stadium in the NFL.
