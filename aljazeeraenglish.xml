   <media:description>Coronavirus is not only taking a toll on health, but also livelihoods.
More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment relief in the United States since March.
Behind every one of those grim unemployment statistics is a story of personal loss.
Al Jazeera's John Hendren spoke with a woman from Chicago who was working two jobs to make ends meet until the pandemic struck.

   <media:description>On May third, the Venezuelan government announced it had detained a group of what it called mercenaries - trying to reach Venezuela on speedboats along with several dozen Colombians. 
The group reportedly numbered around 50. 
At least eight people were killed in the incident as the Venezuelans in effect ambushed the group, having apparently waited for them on the shore. 
The mission, according to the government, was to kill Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro and spark a coup in Caracas.
But others claim the plan was to abduct Maduro, and then take him - nobody knows where. 
A Florida-based security company has claimed responsibility for the operation - which was coordinated with Venezuela's opposition, led by Juan Guaido. 
But President Maduro insists the United States, and specifically President Trump, knew about the plot from the start. 
As the U.S and most of Latin America want Nicolas Maduro out of power, what does this mean for Venezuela?

Presenter: Peter Dobbie

   <media:description>&quot;The bad news is that everyone is a potential victim. But the good news is that everyone is a potential solution...Sensitise the masses to sanitise. Keep a social distance and quarantine.&quot; 

These are the words of Bobi Wine and Nubian Li in their campaigning anthem &quot;Corona Virus Alert,&quot; released to raise awareness of the pandemic in Uganda. The video, which only came out last month, has almost two million views on YouTube. 

The song is just the latest chapter in a career that has fused music icon status with politics. Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has called on the Ugandan government to improve public services as part of its strategy to defeat the virus. He has also criticised other African governments for not maintaining better health care systems for their populations, while investing in weapons and &quot;curtailing the voices of the people&quot;. 

Uganda has had less than 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus and the country remains in lockdown. There are risks looming, though. It is home to more than one million refugees, primarily from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo - the biggest refugee population in Africa. Many experts fear the virus could have a devastating impact if it reaches the refugee camps. 

An elected member of parliament, Wine last year announced that in 2021 he would run for president against the country’s longtime leader Yoweri Museveni. His music is now banned, he’s been arrested several times, and he is barred from holding rallies for his People Power Party. He is also fighting a charge of treason that is likely to follow him into election year. 

In this episode of The Stream, Bobi Wine joins us from Kampala to perform his new song and to talk about public health and the coronavirus in Uganda.

   <media:description>The depth and breadth of the damage inflicted on the United States economy by coronavirus lockdown measures came into sharp, painful focus on Friday with government figures showing 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs in April. 

Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics also showed the unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.7 percent  last month - the highest since the Great Depression.

   <media:description>Despite a full lockdown in the country, the Colombian government has intensified the manual eradication of coca plants in remote parts of the country.
It is the main ingredient for cocaine and is grown in remote parts of the country by growers who depend on the crop for their livelihood.
Their representatives, and an international coalition of human rights organisations, are demanding a stop to the operations for health reasons.

   <media:description>Families in Venezuela are searching for relatives they say have become political prisoners after a failed coup attempt to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro. 
According to a Washington Post newspaper report, Venezuela's opposition members negotiated a $213m deal with a small Florida security company to invade the country on May 3.
Venezuelan authorities have arrested more than a dozen people, including Americans who work for a firm, they say were part of the plot.
The US government denies any involvement.

   <media:description>It has been nearly two months since Qatar implemented a series of measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, the highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

The government has since closed schools, issued stay-at-home orders and imposed travel bans on travellers from many countries.

But while the number of deaths here remains low, infection rates continue to rise.

On Talk to Al Jazeera, we speak to Qatar's minister of public health, Dr Hanan Mohamed al-Kuwari, about the government's efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

   <media:description>The US is reportedly removing Patriot anti-missile systems and other military assets from Saudi Arabia's oil facilities as it winds down a military build-up that began as tensions with Iran flared up last year, according to the Wall Street Journal newspaper.
The reductions are said to be based on assessments by some officials that Tehran no longer poses an immediate threat to US strategic interests.

To discuss this Al Jazeera spoke earlier with Samuel Ramani via Skype from Toronto.
He is a Middle East analyst and contributor to The Washington Post newspaper and Foreign Policy magazine.
He says the withdrawal has more to do with Saudi Arabia's oil price war with Russia.

   <media:description>The United Nations's World Food Program says billions of dollars are needed to help poorer countries cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effects.

It is asking world leaders to contribute, saying that the coronavirus could push an additional 135 million people to the brink of starvation, warning that a failure to help could result in famines and conflict. 

 Al Jazeera’s James Bays reports from the United Nations in New York, in the US.

   <media:description>The US Justice Department is dropping its case against President Donald Trump’s first National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn.

The former general was fired in the early days of the Trump administration after he admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to Washington.

Flynn was convicted during an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election but had been seeking to withdraw his guilty plea.

Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher reports from Washington, DC.
