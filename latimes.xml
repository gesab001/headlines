County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA -- THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 2020: Kids do flips off the lifeguard tower while others relax on the sand on the last day of open beaches in Huntington Beach after Gov. Newsom announced the "hard close" of all Orange County state and local beaches Thursday, April 30, 2020. Newsom's retaliation came after thousands of Californians flocked to the shoreline there over the weekend in defiance of a statewide stay-at-home order enacted to stem the spread of the coronavirus. "When you contact the police chiefs to enforce your will as a leader-in my book you establish a police state" said Huntington Beach resident Pete Hamborg. "It's a moment that Gavin Newsom is taking away from us and are the very moments that empower us to deal with this crisis on a day-to-day basis." "I think the beach, which belongs to all Californians, is critical to our emotional health and well-being." (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
