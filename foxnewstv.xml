President Trump visited sites of riots and destruction in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Tuesday to show support to law enforcement amid the protests following the Jacob Blake shooting. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) joins the Rundown to weigh in on the ongoing violent protests across the country. He shares his story of being confronted by angry protesters after the Republican National Convention in D.C. last week. Plus, Sen. Paul weighs in on the death of Breonna Taylor and a bill he introduced to prohibit no-knock warrants, the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act.

The coronavirus has put the economy in recession, prompting congress to spend trillions of dollars so most Americans can get direct payments. But after Congress hit a stalemate on an additional relief package, President Trump signed an executive order cutting payroll tax. FOX Business correspondent Edward Lawrence discusses who will be seeing extra funds in their account, how long it will last and why those who receive it will have to pay it back at the beginning of 2021.

Plus, commentary by Jimmy Failla, host of &quot;Fox Across America.&quot;
