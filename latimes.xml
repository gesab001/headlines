County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

Some of the land making up Bruce's Beach was purchased by African American couple Willa and Charles Bruce, in 1912, establishing a resort that was open to African Americans. But by the 1920s, racial tensions grew in the beach community and the city condemned the properties. The park was renamed multiple times over the next 80 years and in 2007, was re-named for the Bruce family, responsible for trying to bring change and equality to the city. (Jay L.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[This undated photo provided by the Western Rivers Conservancy shows lupines on the Adler Ranch in Big Sur on the coast of California south of Monterey. A Native American tribe has reclaimed a small part of ancestral lands on California's Big Sur coast that were lost to Spanish colonial settlement nearly 250 years ago. The Mercury News reports the Esselen Tribe of Monterey County closed escrow on 1,199 acres about 5 miles inland from the ocean that was part of a $4.5 million deal involving the state and the Western Rivers Conservancy. It marks the first restoration of any lands to the tribe. The land encompasses old-growth redwoods, oak woodlands, meadows and endangered steelhead trout.
