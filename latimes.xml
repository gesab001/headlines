Spruill is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept., saying that deputies fabricated a story that he shot at them and then falsely arrested him for attempted murder. He was in jail for six months after the Dec. 2019 incident and is now trying to put his life back together. Finding work as a trained welder is difficult for Spruill because his charges show up whenever a potential employer does a background check. He advises people to "be more cautious and stay woke. A lot of bad things happen to people that go under the radar." He went onto say "I hope to come out of it and bring awareness to it (the Sheriff's Dept.) and maybe someone else will be treated better." (Josie Norris / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

For an hour each Thursday afternoon, the group of four or five girls play with dolls and talk about anything from their home dynamics to their friends at school. The idea is to give these girls a space to experience their own innocence in an attempt to at least partially address the effects of adultification bias (a form of racial prejudice where children of minority groups, particularly black girls, are treated as being more mature than they actually are by a reasonable social standard of development).
