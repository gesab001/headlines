   <media:description>A US court has issued a subpoena against the Saudi crown prince in relation to former Saudi intelligence agent Saad al-Jabri.
The court order also covers a number of other people and entities, including residents of the US.
Saad al-Jabri filed a lawsuit accusing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of sending a hit squad to kill him two years ago. 
He lives in Canada, reportedly under increased protection by police and private security guards.

Bruce Fein is a former US Associate Deputy Attorney General, and he joins us live from Washington DC through Skype to discuss the latest news.

   <media:description>Hong Kong media tycoon, Jimmy Lai, has been detained, one of seven people arrested under the new, Beijing-imposed national security law.
Lai is the most high-profile individual arrested yet under the new law.
An executive in Lai's media group says he was arrested on suspicion of &quot;colluding with foreign powers&quot;; he had already been facing multiple charges for his role in the city's pro-democracy movement.
The police also raided the offices of Lai's newspaper.

Al Jazeera's Sarah Clarke reports live from Hong Kong.

   <media:description>The coronavirus pandemic poses ''grave health threat'' to the world's Indigenous people, according to the United Nations. 
The UN says the pandemic emphasises the importance of indigenous peoples being allowed to exercise their right to self-determination, for their particular needs to be recognised.
In Brazil, COVID-19 has killed hundreds of people in its vulnerable Indigenous communities, infecting tens of thousands in many communities already struggling against environmental damage and economic hardship.

   <media:description>Protesters have taken to the streets in cities across Belarus after official exit polls showed President Alexander Lukashenko poised for a landslide win, meaning he could extend his quarter-century in power.
The opposition says the ballot was a fraud and “people who are all very angry, calling the election a huge fraud” filled the streets of the capital Minsk, according to Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen.
Late on Sunday, the atmosphere in the city was tense as riot police faced off with opposition protesters, beating some with truncheons and using flash-bang grenades to try to disperse them.
Preliminary results are not expected until Monday.

Al Jazeera’s Laura Burdon-Manley reports.

   <media:description>World powers agreed to provide &quot;major resources&quot; to help Beirut recover from the enormous explosion that destroyed swaths of the capital and pledged not to let its people down.
The &quot;assistance should be timely, sufficient and consistent with the needs of the Lebanese people ... and directly delivered to the Lebanese population, with utmost efficiency and transparency,&quot; they said in a communique.
Lebanon's partners were ready to support the country's longer-term economic recovery and required that Lebanon's leaders committed fully to the reforms expected by their people, it added.

   <media:description>Lebanon was in a dire state even before Tuesday's explosions in Beirut.
The government is bankrupt, millions of Lebanese are jobless, and the country is hosting 1.5 Syrian refugees.
The huge blast made things worse by destroying the main port for a nation heavily reliant on food imports.
300,000 homeless people Beirut have received little help from the government.
How will aid organisations deal with the challenge?

   <media:description>Belarus is voting in an election pitting President Alexander Lukashenko against a former teacher who emerged from obscurity to lead the biggest challenge in years against the man once dubbed &quot;Europe's last dictator&quot;.
As he cast his ballot in the election, Lukashenko on Sunday said he would make sure there is no civil-war-like situation in Belarus, calling the situation &quot;stable&quot;. &quot;I guarantee it,&quot; he said.
Lukashenko, 65, is almost certain to win a sixth consecutive term, but could face a new wave of protests amid anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, and his human rights record.
A former Soviet collective farm manager, Lukashenko has ruled the country of 9.5 million since 1994.

   <media:description>Physical distancing, handwashing and the wearing of face masks have become a new normal as the novel coronavirus pandemic continues without any sign of respite. But the looming threat of COVID-19 outbreaks is none more acute than among communities of displaced people, particularly those living in overcrowded refugee camps and settlements.

Aid teams already near the limits of their capacity before the pandemic are now in a round-the-clock battle to prevent and fight coronavirus outbreaks, both in camps and within the wider community. 

Even when it is being held at bay, the mere threat of coronavirus is having a debilitating impact on dispossessed people. Families reliant on wages from jobs worked outside camps and settlements have been hit hard by tough exit and entry rules. UNHCR says 89 percent of displaced people in Iraq who responded to a recent survey said COVID-19 had affected their livelihood. 

Meanwhile, displaced people worry that they are seen unfairly as carriers of a disease that frightens the public imagination – and that coronavirus will only further marginalise them.

The Stream will look at how refugees in three different parts of the world are coping with the threat of coronavirus and ask what help they most desperately need.

   <media:description>Afghanistan's president is backing the release of 400 Taliban prisoners.
Ashraf Ghani made his decision after the Loya Jirga consultative body approved freeing the so-called 'hardcore' prisoners.
Their release has been a pre-condition for the armed group to hold peace talks with the government.
Al Jazeera's Osama Bin Javaid has more.

   <media:description>It’s now 40 years since a two-day US rescue mission known as Operation Eagle Claw failed in the desert near Tabas, Iran.

The top secret mission, led by special forces, was an attempt by then US President Jimmy Carter to bring home more than 50 Americans held hostage by Iranian revolutionaries for more than 400 days in the foreign ministry and US Embassy in Tehran.

Ultimately, the mission was aborted amid a perfect storm of problems, including malfunctioning helicopters. Eight American soldiers and one Iranian on the ground were killed when a helicopter crashed. Not a single captive was rescued.

A new documentary, ‘Desert One', takes an in-depth look at the mission and features interviews with Carter, former hostages, journalists and some of the Iranian student revolutionaries who planned the takeover of the embassy.

In the US, the crisis is widely considered a key reason why Carter lost a presidential election to Ronald Reagan. In Iran, it is largely seen as payback for a US- and UK-backed coup that in 1953 overthrew a democratically-elected prime minister and installed a king - or Shah - who ruled with an iron first until he was toppled during the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

In this episode of The Stream, we discuss the making of the new documentary and examine the long-term impacts of the hostage crisis.

   <media:description>The United States health secretary has just arrived in Taiwan for a visit that has angered China.
Alex Azar's three-day trip is being hailed as an opportunity to strengthen cooperation in combating COVID-19.   
But Beijing has warned President Donald Trump that the visit threatens peace and stability in the region.  
It is the highest-level visit to the island by an American diplomat in more than 40 years.
Al Jazeera's Sarah Clarke reports.

   <media:description>Protesters in Thailand say the arrest of two leaders will not stop their campaign to force the government out.
The pair were charged with sedition and breaking coronavirus rules in connection with recent protests, before being released on bail.
And, as Al Jazeera's Wayne Hay reports, the demonstrations are likely to grow into an even larger movement as the economy worsens amid the coronavirus pandemic.

   <media:description>How will Lebanon ever recover? Lebanon suffered a devastating ammonium nitrate explosion in early August.
The port in Beirut is barely recognisable, more than a quarter of a million people are homeless and the death toll is high.  People are angry.  So what happened? And how will the almost bankrupt country recover?

   <media:description>The calls for complete political reform in Lebanon are growing louder after the Beirut port explosion that killed at least 158 people on Tuesday.
Lebanon's information minister has become the first senior member of the government to resign since it happened.
Manal Abdel Samad says there's little hope for change. 
Six MPs have now resigned. And the most powerful Christian leader, Maronite Patriarch Beshara Boutros al-Rai is urging the whole cabinet to quit.  

Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr joins us live from Beirut, Lebanon.
