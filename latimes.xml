    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[LAKEWOOD, CA - APRIL 26, 2020 - - Lt. Col. Sam Sachs, a World War II veteran, celebrates his 105th birthday with well wishers at the Mom & Dad's House, an assisted living facility, in Lakewood on April 27, 2020. Lt. Col. Sachs appealed to the public for birthday cards after the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of a big celebration and wound up receiving thousands, including a letter and photo from President Donald Trump. A surprise parade of cars drove by the senior living home where Sachs resides. Over 400 American flags were brought by community members in honor of his birthday. Well-wishers from throughout the United States and the world have sent birthday cards. The farthest birthday card came from South Korea. "Does life get any better than this," said Lt. Col. Sachs. "I lived a life of a dream," he concluded. Lt. Col. Sachs, who was in the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, was a high school teacher for 35 years in Huntington Park. He raised his family in Cerritos. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

"I'm out here praying for the city," Martinez said. "And to show an example of Christ, who is love. Our freedom doesn't come from a spirit of anarchy. Right now our main focus is loving each other at any cost. The lord says today that he hears the cries of his people and to trust him. Because love overcomes everything."

In San Clemente the local council voted to reopen the beach for recreational activity such as walking, running, swimming and surfing, but have also said residents should not bring a blanket and hang out starting Saturday morning at 6am. The city is attempting to limit access to local residents by keeping parking lots closed, and other Orange county officials have urged out-of-town residents not to visit the beaches and parks that remain open.

For decades, the South Central Family Health Center has been a refuge for low-income families most at risk. They rely on the clinic for medical help; also for help with homeless services, food coupons and emotional support for domestic violence. In recent weeks, so many patients have stopped attending the clinic due to Coronavirus fears, it's put the clinics funding at risk. Officials have furloughed employees, slashed services and put major projects on hold. They said worry that after the pandemic ends, the clinic may not be able to stay open or will only offer a fraction of the critical services it's known for.

"It takes a village to save a village," Coe said, "because we are the Laguna Woods Village." Orange County has signed a lease to use a Laguna Woods Hotel to house 19 homeless patients with coronavirus that some neighbors - mostly a retirement community - and city officials are opposing. The county is trying to meet Gov. Newsom's mandate to shelter homeless in motels and hotels in order to help combat spread of coronavirus. (Allen J.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[SANTA ANA, CA -- TUESDAY, APRIL 21, 2020: Mason Nakamura holds a photo of himself with his late mother, Mary Nakamura, at his home in Santa Ana, CA, on April 21, 2020. Mary Nakamura received her stimulus payment on April 15. There's just one problem, she's deceased. The 96-year-old died about a year ago but her son Mason Nakamura, who handles her estate account, said his mother received a $1200 check. He wants to give that money back to the IRS, saying it doesn't make sense. Nakamura's mother is likely one of thousands who are deceased but received payments anyway. IRS experts said it's actually lawful for the dead to get stimulus payments and that it's not an error. The priority was put on getting payments out as quickly as possible and weeding out the dead would have likely delayed the process by weeks, if not months. (Allen J.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 3, 2020: A Palm Springs resident finds the serenity of a closed golf course the perfect place for afternoon reading during the coronavirus pandemic at Tahquitz Creek Golf Resort on April 3, 2020 in Palm Springs. All the golf courses are closed in the desert communities. Declining to give his name, he said he's reading a novel by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Which seems very relevant during these times. Some of Nietzsche's famous quotes are, "To live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering," and "That which does not kill us makes us stronger." Also, "Without music, life would be a mistake."]]></media:description>
