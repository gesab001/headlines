Former Congressman Trey Gowdy discusses how unfairness has impacted politics, the media and the justice system.

In the finale of his three-part series, Trey discusses how a truly impartial judge rules against what they believe personally in favor of the law and the facts, the difference between fake news and biased news and the examples of the media double standard when it comes to former Vice President Biden's assault allegations, the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn and the behavior of Rep. Adam Schiff.
