Congressional negotiations over coronavirus relief funding are at a standstill as Americans continue to struggle during the outbreak. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) weighs in on what he thinks needs to be in the bill, and the struggles rural America is having during the pandemic. He also discusses his concerns about mail-in ballots and the Post Office for the presidential election.

While America's economy as a whole has suffered thanks to the coronavirus, the airline industry has been hit particularly hard. Lockdowns, social-distancing mandates and travel restrictions have made the future uncertain for many airlines and the millions they employ. Ben Baldanza, former CEO of Spirit Airlines, joins host Dave Anthony to discuss the economic impact of the pandemic, the debate over a possible 'bailout' from Washington and what the industry is doing to keep its customers safe.

Plus, commentary by FOX News Contributor Nicole Saphier.
