   <media:description>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says workers must return to work if they cannot do so from home, the first steps of a plan to ease coronavirus lockdown measures, nearly seven weeks after they were imposed.
Johnson announced a new virus alert system which allows people to spend more time outdoors.  
The UK has the highest death toll in Europe.
But critics say Johnson is sending out mixed messages. 

Al Jazeeraâ€™s Paul Brennan reports from London.

   <media:description>United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has addressed the nation, providing new guidance on dealing with the coronavirus lockdown.
The UK has recorded nearly 32,000 deaths, the most in Europe and the second-highest pandemic toll worldwide. 
Ahead of the prime minister's speech, the government was accused of confusing the public with a new &quot;stay alert&quot; message, which replaces the earlier &quot;stay at home&quot; slogan.  
Kevin Craig, the chief executive officer of Political Lobbying and Media Relations Ltd (PLMR), a political communications agency in the UK, talks to Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>Foreign workers are often the backbone of many societies.
They are doctors, nurses, shop assistants and managers. 
Others take low-skilled work that citizens of wealthier nations won't do.
They have families that depend on the money they send back home.
But millions of migrant workers have seen their livelihoods evaporate as the coronavirus spreads.
Salaries are being cut, or staff fired as economies are disrupted by lockdowns.
The World Bank says global remittances will drop by 20 percent this year, the sharpest fall in recent history.
So will the crisis change the way wealthy countries use foreign labour?

   <media:description>&quot;The bad news is that everyone is a potential victim. But the good news is that everyone is a potential solution...Sensitise the masses to sanitise. Keep a social distance and quarantine.&quot;
 
These are the words of Bobi Wine and Nubian Li in their campaigning anthem &quot;Corona Virus Alert,&quot; released to raise awareness of the pandemic in Uganda. The video, which only came out last month, has almost two million views on YouTube. 
 
The song is just the latest chapter in a career that has fused music icon status with politics. Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has called on the Ugandan government to improve public services as part of its strategy to defeat the virus. He has also criticised other African governments for not maintaining better health care systems for their populations, while investing in weapons and &quot;curtailing the voices of the people&quot;. 
 
Uganda has had less than 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus and the country remains in lockdown. There are risks looming, though. It is home to more than one million refugees, primarily from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo - the biggest refugee population in Africa. Many experts fear the virus could have a devastating impact if it reaches the refugee camps. 
 
An elected member of parliament, Wine last year announced that in 2021 he would run for president against the countryâ€™s longtime leader Yoweri Museveni. His music is now banned, heâ€™s been arrested several times, and he is barred from holding rallies for his People Power Party. He is also fighting a charge of treason that is likely to follow him into election year. 
 
In this episode of The Stream, Bobi Wine joins us from Kampala to perform his new song and to talk about public health and the coronavirus in Uganda.

   <media:description>Mexicoâ€™s government says it is now at the peak of its COVID-19 pandemic. 
The country has reported more than 33,000 infections and at least 3,000 deaths.
But experts say that number could be much higher.

   <media:description>Nearly 80,000 people have now died from the novel coronavirus in the United States.
It is the highest death toll of any country in the world and comes as some states reopen for business.
President Donald Trump continues to describe his administration's handling of the crisis as a success.
But, as Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna reports, the US's response is facing criticism for their perceived lack of a pandemic response strategy.

   <media:description>Governments and security forces around the world are using technology to track peopleâ€™s health and where they go, to stop the spread of COVID-19.
Places like Poland and Hong Kong have made mobile tracking apps mandatory for people in quarantine. In the UK drones warn pedestrians not to go for walks.
But how much surveillance is too much?
Start Here asks whether mass monitoring during the pandemic comes at the expense of our privacy.

   <media:description>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to give a briefing later on Sunday, outlining plans to ease the United Kingdom's lockdown.
It is expected to involve getting some people back to work.
But with changes to the way offices operate and the way people commute, it will not be the same as before.

   <media:description>A major outbreak of the coronavirus appears to have been averted but the pandemic devastated an already collapsing economy. Many businesses did not survive.
Lebanon is slowly emerging from its lockdown.
Weeks of closures have caused further damage to an economy that was already in freefall after months of political and financial turmoil.
And the hospitality sector is paying a heavy price, as at least 18,000 hotel employees have lost their jobs in recent months.

   <media:description>The World Bank says Nigeria needs hundreds of billions of dollars to bridge its housing deficit. 
Home ownership is at a mere 25 percent, and Nigerians are finding it harder to buy as incomes fall along with the price of oil, the country's main earner.

Al Jazeeraâ€™s Ahmed Idris reports from Abuja, Nigeria.

   <media:description>Former President Barack Obama has described Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic there as &quot;an absolute chaotic disaster&quot;.
Obama said this in a conference call with former members of his administration, which was leaked.
He added that the current administration appears to have a mindset of &quot;what's in it for me&quot;, and &quot;to heck with everybody else&quot;.
The Democrat urged his supporters to back presidential candidate Joe Biden and said he will be campaigning hard for Biden's White House bid.
The United States has reported about 1.3 million coronavirus infections and more than 77,000 deaths.
 
To discuss this, Al Jazeera spoke to Eric Ham via Skype from Washington, DC.
He is a US political analyst and author of The GOP civil war, a book on the Republican Party.
He says the comments by President Obama may have been strategic.
