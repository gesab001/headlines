    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA -- THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 2020: Kids do flips off the lifeguard tower while others relax on the sand on the last day of open beaches in Huntington Beach after Gov. Newsom announced the "hard close" of all Orange County state and local beaches Thursday, April 30, 2020. Newsom's retaliation came after thousands of Californians flocked to the shoreline there over the weekend in defiance of a statewide stay-at-home order enacted to stem the spread of the coronavirus. "When you contact the police chiefs to enforce your will as a leader-in my book you establish a police state" said Huntington Beach resident Pete Hamborg. "It's a moment that Gavin Newsom is taking away from us and are the very moments that empower us to deal with this crisis on a day-to-day basis." "I think the beach, which belongs to all Californians, is critical to our emotional health and well-being." (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

Newsom announced the "hard close" of all Orange County state and local beaches Thursday, April 30, 2020. "I think it's what needs to be done," Christopher said. "I saw it last week and it was packed." Newsom's retaliation came after thousands of Californians flocked to the shoreline there over the weekend in defiance of a statewide stay-at-home order enacted to stem the spread of the coronavirus. "When you contact the police chiefs to enforce your will as a leader-in my book you establish a police state" said Huntington Beach resident Pete Hamborg. "It's a moment that Gavin Newsom is taking away from us and are the very moments that empower us to deal with this crisis on a day-to-day basis." "I think the beach, which belongs to all Californians, is critical to our emotional health and well-being." (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

"When you contact the police chiefs to enforce your will as a leader-in my book you establish a police state" said Huntington Beach resident Pete Hamborg.
