Surfing will make its Olympic debut where it will be on display for the first time. Simpson coached Andino and offered advice on surfboard choices that would work well in Japan. It was Andino's last practice before heading to Japan on Wednesday. Andino turned heads in the water and on the beach as surfers were surprised to see the well-known local Olympian among them at a surf spot not known for high-performance perfect waves. Andino took time to pose for a photo with a young surfer on the beach after his training session. Andino will be joining John John Florence, of Hawaii, representing U.S.A. Another fellow San Clemente surfer, Caroline Marks will be joining Carissa Moore of Hawaii as they represent the U.S.A. women's team. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

Surfing will make its Olympic debut where it will be on display for the first time. Simpson coached Andino and offered advice on surfboard choices that would work well in Japan. It was Andino's last practice before heading to Japan on Wednesday. Andino turned heads in the water and on the beach as surfers were surprised to see the well-known local Olympian among them at a surf spot not known for high-performance perfect waves. Andino took time to pose for a photo with a young surfer on the beach after his training session. Andino will be joining John John Florence, of Hawaii, representing U.S.A. Another fellow San Clemente surfer, Caroline Marks will be joining Carissa Moore of Hawaii as they represent the U.S.A. women's team. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
