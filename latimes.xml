He says he can't give a timeline on when the decision will be made. The renaming of Squaw Valley Ski Resort is one of many efforts across the nation to address colonialism and indigenous oppression.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[BOSTON, MA - AUGUST 27: Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli, right, leave the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston on Aug. 27, 2019. A judge says actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, can continue using a law firm that recently represented the University of Southern California. The couple appeared in Boston federal court on Tuesday to settle a dispute over their choice of lawyers in a sweeping college admissions bribery case. Prosecutors had said their lawyers pose a potential conflict of interest. Loughlin and Giannulli say the firms work for USC was unrelated to the admissions case and was handled by different lawyers.

DeAngelo Jr., 74, was sentenced to 11 life sentences in prison without the possibility of parole, one life sentence with the possibility of parole and an additional eight year sentence under a plea agreement that allowed him to avoid the death sentence. In June, DeAngelo Jr. admitted being the infamous Golden State Killer. The former police officer in California eluded capture for four decades. He admitted killing 13 people and raping nearly 50 people in the 1970s and 1980s. The sentencing was held at the University Union, a large enough space so that people could maintain physical distance, amid the coronavirus pandemic.]]></media:description>
