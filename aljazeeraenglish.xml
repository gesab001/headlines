   <media:description>Famed American mycologist and entrepreneur Paul Stamets thinks that mushrooms can save the world. In a 2008 TED talk, viewed more than six million times, Stamets explained the many ways he believes mushrooms can help restore ecological balance and heal the planet.  

Mushrooms, the fruiting body growing from the ground, are well known for their psychedelic and medicinal properties. But a growing body of evidence suggests mycelium, the underground reproductive structures of the organism, could be the environment’s greatest ally in fighting the climate crisis. 

 Stamets says mushrooms contain the solution to just about every man-made problem, from carbon pollution and oil spills, to plastic waste and, even, pandemics. Fungi, of which there are some 1 - 1.5 million species, can provide  a critical understanding of how the world works. Yet, they receive very little attention in conservation efforts, according to a report by Britain's Botanical Botanic Gardens at Kew.

 In a new documentary, ‘Fantastic Fungi’, filmmaker Louis Schwartzberg journeys into the world of mycology with Stamets and other mushroom enthusiasts. For Stamets, this mission is deeply personal: he lost his stutter after a psychedelic experience and says his mother overcame a terminal cancer diagnosis through the use of turkey tail mushrooms.

In this episode of The Stream, we explore the magical world of mushrooms with Paul Stamets and ask whether his ideas really could change the planet.

   <media:description>Millions of students across twelve African countries have headed back to class as schools reopened after a six-month coronavirus lockdown. 
In Nigeria, nearly 40 million of them will now have to try to catch-up on missed schoolwork. 
But they will also return to a new set of rules as the government continues the struggle to stop the spread.

   <media:description>The UK has put one of its biggest cities, Liverpool, under tight COVID-19 restrictions. 
Movement will be restricted and pubs will be closed down. 
A number of other northern cities have escaped such tough measures, but will face a clampdown if infection numbers keep rising.

   <media:description>Russia's foreign minister says Turkey will not be involved in peace talks over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
The foreign ministers of Armenia and Russia have been meeting in Moscow.
Azerbaijan had proposed that Turkey be present in the talks.
Armenia and Azerbaijan are accusing each other of violating a humanitarian ceasefire, which has left cassualties on both sides.
It comes as Armenian officials say 45 more of their servicemen were killed on Monday

   <media:description>Its theories have been repeatedly debunked, yet the conspiracy movement known as 'QAnon' continues to thrive.
Its supporters say U.S. President Donald Trump is saving the world from an elite cult of Satan-worshipping paedophiles made up of Democratic Party politicians, billionaires and Hollywood celebrities.  
Many of the theories repeat centuries-old anti-Semitic propaganda.
Now, it is also growing in other parts of the world, particularly the UK and Germany.

   <media:description>&quot;An uninhabitable hell for millions of people.&quot; 
That's what the planet is becoming due to the lack of action on climate change - according to a strongly worded United Nations report. 
It says in the past two decades, more than 7,000 major natural disasters have been recorded. 
That figure's nearly doubled in the past 20 years. 
The increases are mostly attributed to floods and storms. 
The UN is accusing political and business leaders of willingly 'sowing the seeds of our own destruction.'
And says industrial nations have failed miserably on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Researchers on the biggest mission to the North Pole have also released some of their findings. 
They've documented extensive amounts of sea ice melting away.
And predict there'll be ice-free Arctic summers within the next few decades.

   <media:description>Can food be political? Can it position people within a certain cultural group? Does what you eat say exactly who you are? 
 
For diaspora communities, food is deeply intertwined with a sense of self. It can be an expression of faith, culture, and even politics.
 
“It’s the last vestige of culture that people shed … there’s some aspects of maternal culture that you’ll lose right away [but] with food … there are more opportunities to connect to memory and family and place. It’s the hardest to give up,” Jennifer Berg, Director of Food Studies at New York University, told TED in an interview.

There is no doubt that food provides a distinct, physical link to one’s culture and history and, according to David L. Weller, Professor of Food Science at the University of Ithaca, &quot;despite variability in the importance that immigrants attribute to food, it remains one of the most resilient tools … [of] identity formation and maintenance.&quot;

Though most people in the developed world are now removed from the production of food, its significance has not diminished. In Europe, sales of fish skyrocket during Lent and, in the Middle East, meat production vastly increases during Ramadan.

In this episode of The Stream, we’ll speak to immigrant cooks about the food they love to cook and ask how it connects them to their history, culture and traditions.

   <media:description>What does the COVID-19 outbreak in Trump's administration mean for the election? 
“The fact that [we’re facing COVID-19], the biggest crisis in the world, and the president himself cannot seem to handle it doesn't inspire much confidence that he should be the president of the US anymore.”
Says Waleed Shahid, spokesperson for Justice Democrats, about the upcoming US election, the gap between Democratic progressives and moderates, and the future of American democracy.

   <media:description>Water levels in the Paraguay River, one of longest rivers in South America, have dropped to their lowest point in half a century.
 
The governments of Paraguay and Brazil say water has been released from a hydroelectric dam to raise river levels.
 
But environmentalists say much more needs to be done.

   <media:description>An undercover investigation by Al Jazeera has exposed high-ranking officials in Cyprus expressing a willingness to help convicted criminals obtain EU citizenship. 
In August, Al Jazeera’s Investigative Unit released The Cyprus Papers, which revealed serious flaws in the country’s citizen-by-investment programme.
Now, as Al Jazeera's Phil Rees reports, the investigation leads to the highest offices in the Cypriot state.

   <media:description>People in Pakistan say they are struggling to afford to buy the basics and more people are being pushed into poverty.
The coronavirus crisis has seen a rise in food prices and caused many job losses. 
And, as Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder reports from Islamabad, the World Bank is warning the next two years could be tough.

   <media:description>Brazil is the world's third largest food producer - but new data has revealed that more than 10 million Brazilians are going hungry.
And as the coronavirus pandemic plunges more people into poverty, that number is set to rise.

   <media:description>Human rights organisations and political opponents have accused the Tanzanian government of political oppression ahead of this month's general election.
President John Pombe Magufuli has been accused of presiding over a government that is intolerant of dissent and has curtailed rights of expression and the media.
Al Jazeera spoke with the main opposition candidate about his fears for the vote.

Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi reports.

   <media:description>Al Jazeera’s Investigative Unit exposes how a convicted criminal might obtain a European passport in Cyprus - for the right price. Undercover reporters reveal a two-track citizenship by investment scheme, where “problematic” applicants pay more money. The investigation leads to the highest offices of the Cypriot state, where we are given the blueprint on how to bypass the rules.
When confronted with evidence, all involved denied wrongdoing. They claimed that they had suspicions of the undercover team, that they supported and made a report against the journalists to the Cyprus’ anti-money laundering unit.
