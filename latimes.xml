    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[FILE - In this Aug. 21, 2009 file photo, water trickles over Copco 1 Dam on the Klamath River outside Hornbrook, Calif. The process to relicense the hydroelectric dam system on the Klamath River has restarted again as historic settlement agreements to remove four of the dams have thus far failed to make headway in Congress this year. The Klamath River basin, which straddles Oregon and California, has long been the site of intense political fights over the sharing of scarce water between farms and fish. The agreements to remove the dams, hammered out by farmers, tribes, environmentalists and states, are a compromise aimed to restore the river for imperiled salmon and steelhead, and give farmers greater certainty about irrigation water.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[CATALINA ISLAND, CA - AUGUST 07: Activist David Sanchez, of Huntington Park, who led the Brown Berets during the occupational protest in Catalina Island in 1972 as part of the Chicano Moratorium, revisit the point where he once protested in Avalon Friday, Aug. 7, 2020 in Catalina Island. The group of 26 planted a large Mexican flag on the point, referred to as Burrito Point by some locals, above the Chimes Tower and claimed the island in the name of Mexico. The Brown Berets are a pro-Chicano organization that emerged during the Chicano Movement in the late1960s to address the issues of educational reform, farm workers' rights, police brutality, anti-war activities and other problems confronting the Chicano community and was founded by Sanchez.
