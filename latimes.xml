Weekends probably included an outing to a bar, house show or party.

Students had to leave campuses. Classes went online. Graduations too.The 2020 fall semester is going to be very different for everyone. Here are some ways make the most out of it, whatever it looks like, and get a handle on some trickier issues and news updates.]]></content:encoded>

He still lives in the Bayview District and spent many holidays at the homes on Topeka Ave. and another, on Apollo St. in the Bayview District owned by his great-aunts. After his great-aunts died, their adult children sold the houses during the tech-fueled real estate boom and Walton?s family scattered to Sacramento and the far East Bay communities of Vallejo and Antioch. The loss of those physical anchors, so full of childhood memories, is devastating, said Walton. ?Not having that family connection, not having that place where people gathered for decades? to lose that is reflective of what?s happening across San Francisco.?
