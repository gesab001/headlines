   <media:description>The Dayton Peace Accords ended the Bosnian war 25 years ago.
The US brokered deal stopped an ethnic conflict that killed 100,000 people and displaced two million others.
However, it divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into two entities, created a complex political system and entrenched divisions between Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
So can Bosnia and Herzegovina heal the widening fractures in society?

   <media:description>An oil tanker off Saudi Arabia’s port city of Jeddah has been hit by an unidentified “external source” that caused a fire and an explosion, a shipping company said, suggesting another vessel has come under attack off the kingdom amid its years-long war in Yemen.
In a statement on Monday, shipping company Hafnia said all 22 sailors on board the Singapore-flagged BW Rhine escaped without injury. The company warned it was possible some oil leaked out from the site of the blast.
The ship’s crew put out the fire, the company said, adding that parts of the ship’s hull had been damaged.

   <media:description>The United Nation says child marriage rates have surged in Sierra Leone - because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The UN defines child marriage as a marriage of a girl or boy before the age of 18 and it says the number of girls getting married in Sierra Leone before that age dropped from 56 percent in 2006 to 39 percent 10 years later.

But when schools closed in March, child marriage rates surged.

It estimates that hardships resulting from COVID-19 will drive 13 million more girls to marry before the age of 18.

   <media:description>Bosnia and Herzegovina has marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Peace accords that ended the Bosnian War.
But not everyone is celebrating.
Tens of thousands of displaced people are still unable to return home.
And the country's unresolved issues and dire economic situation mean many Bosnians are leaving to find work abroad.

   <media:description>John Le Carré, the British spy-turned-novelist best known for the Cold War thrillers Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Spy Who Came In From The Cold has died at age 89 of pneumonia.
He worked for Britain's intelligence service before turning his hand to spy novels, which helped define the genre and shed light on the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Le Carre wrote 25 novels and one memoir in a career spanning 60 years, selling some 60 million books worldwide.

   <media:description>In Hong Kong, a growing number of young activists are facing a difficult choice as authorities crack down on dissents. 
Many now have to choose between serving time in prison or leaving the city.  
Aurora, one of the activists who spoke to Al Jazeera, is just 15 years old, making her one of Hong Kong’s youngest political exiles.

Al Jazeera’s Adrian Brown reports from Hong Kong where he met Aurora.

   <media:description>Opposition supporters in Pakistan are protesting against the government in defiance of coronavirus restrictions in the central city of Lahore.
An alliance of 11 opposition parties, known as the Pakistan Democratic Movement, demonstrated on Sunday, before a planned march on the capital of Islamabad in January to pile pressure on Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government.
They want Prime Minister Imran Khan to resign, accusing him of failing to deliver on his promises and mishandling the pandemic.
But Khan says the opposition is trying to pressure him to drop a corruption case against former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

   <media:description>Parents in northern Nigeria are desperately waiting for information about their sons after an attack on a boarding school on Friday; more than 300 boys are reported missing. 
Nigeria's defence ministry says the whereabouts of the so-called bandits are known, and the military is trying to bring the boys back home safely. But there’s anger that the abduction happened at all.
Some of the boys who escaped spoke about their ordeal.

   <media:description>The first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine are arriving at distribution centres across the United States under Operation Warp Speed - the nation's largest immunisation project in history.
Under the programme, officials are hoping to distribute 40 million doses this month and immunise as many as 100 million by the first quarter of 2021. 
The coronavirus pandemic has killed nearly 300,000 Americans - more than anywhere else in the world.

   <media:description>A new generation of climate justice activists has come of age in the five years since 196 countries agreed to sign the Paris Agreement. And with Africa facing disproportionate impacts of climate change, young people across the continent are now leading the fight for urgent and effective action.

Young activists from countries including Uganda, Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya are demanding that domestic, regional and global decision-makers take climate change more seriously, not least because younger generations will be the inheritors of a world profoundly altered by global heating. The impact of climate change is already particularly acute in Africa, with people across the continent already facing extreme weather conditions ranging from floods to prolonged drought – affecting crop yields, provoking tensions over access to land, and driving migration. 

With populations across sub-Saharan Africa among the youngest in the world, youth campaigners are now encouraging other people to act directly within their own communities and change the conversation on climate action and justice. But with Africa only producing between 2 and 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, young campaigners across the continent are also trying to convince world leaders – including those representing the worst polluters on Earth - to act more decisively and give Africa a fighting chance. 

We hear from three climate activists about they are working to ensure a just and stable future for Africa.

   <media:title>Why 2020 was defined by remarkable women | The Stream</media:title>

   <media:description>In a year of overwhelmingly bad news, the grit, stamina and perseverance of women across the world has stood out.

At The Stream, we have worked hard to ensure their achievements are highlighted and amplified. In 2019, we pledged we would never again complete a calendar year without at least 50:50 female representation. 

As we close out 2020 we are proud to report that we exceeded our goal for the second year running. This year 55.98 percent of our guests were female and 44.02 percent were male.

That commitment to amplifying women’s voices was particularly important during the coronavirus pandemic. Women make up 70 percent of healthcare workers across the world. Globally, COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on  women of colour. There are also broader consequences of the virus for reproductive, maternal, and child health that are likely to have an impact for generations to come.  

A recent article in Stat described the importance of amplifying the perspectives of women in 2020: “If women’s views as scientists, health care providers, public health officials, parents, and caregivers are excluded from news stories, their perspectives aren’t included in solutions that will address their particular concerns and challenges. There is a very real risk that gender inequalities will limit the success of the Covid-19 response if we are not able to address gender gaps and allow space for women’s voices and women’s stories.&quot;

In this episode of The Stream, we meet a panel of remarkable women to discuss women on the frontlines of the pandemic, to consider the election of Kamala Harris as US vice president and to find out why Nigeria's huge #EndSARS movement was driven by female activists.

   <media:description>The United Kingdom and the European Union have agreed to “go the extra mile” in coming days to try to reach an elusive trade agreement despite missing their latest deadline to avert a turbulent “no-deal” exit for Britain from the EU’s orbit at the end of the month.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen had given negotiators a Sunday deadline to find a way to resolve an impasse on arrangements that would guarantee Britain zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the EU’s single market.
Both said on Friday that a no-deal Brexit was now the most likely outcome, but on Sunday they mandated negotiators to continue.

   <media:description>It's been nearly five years since Italian student Giulio Regeni was tortured and killed in Egypt.
New videos obtained by Al Jazeera suggest security services followed the 28-year old for more than a month before he disappeared.
Italian prosecutors, frustrated by a lack of cooperation from Egypt, have charged four Egyptian agents with kidnapping and murder.
Egypt has since suspended its own probe.
So what are the broader implications of this case?

Presenter: Imran Khan
