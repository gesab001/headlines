   <media:description>Shelling of Tripoli's airport hit fuel tanks and damaged passenger planes after forces loyal to Libya's renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar fired a barrage of rockets into Tripoli.
The transport ministry said one of the damaged planes was preparing to fly to Spain to retrieve Libyans stranded in Europe by the coronavirus lockdown.
Video shared by an airport worker showed black smoke billowing over the apron. Photographs showed shrapnel damage sprayed across the nose of a passenger plane.
The attack on Saturday was the latest to target Mitiga International Airport in Libya's capital, the seat of the country's internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). Haftar's eastern-based forces have been trying to seize Tripoli since April last year.

   <media:description>The United States is removing its Patriot anti-air missiles, and other weapons systems from Saudi Arabia.
Donald Trump says it is part of an effort to scale back on a military presence that he says doesn't benefit the U.S.
American weapons and fighter jets were sent to the kindgom last year after Saudi-Aramco oil facilities were attacked.
They were also intended as a deterrent, as tensions rose between Tehran and Washington.
But the reduction in the U.S. military presence is believed by some to be based on assessments Iran no longer poses an immediate threat to U.S. strategic interests.
So what's exactly changed?
And is oil politics at play?

   <media:description>May 1 was an important day for the world's poorest nations. It was the day the rich club of G20 nations gave debtors a payment holiday until the end of the year, giving developing nations more headroom to pay for healthcare during the pandemic.

Despite more than 100 countries applying to the International Monetary Fund for emergency aid, the IMF and World Bank have not been so generous, insisting nations keep repaying interest on debt. The IMF had only $200m available in a catastrophe relief fund for the world's poorest countries.

Being Africa's largest oil producer is no guarantee to riches. Nigeria has received $3.4bn from the IMF. With debt as a proportion of its economy at about 30 percent, you would think the country would not get into trouble. But Nigeria is dependent on oil for 90 percent of its export earnings, and with crude prices cratering it has little room to service debt. 

Other nations have precarious finances from Argentina to Ecuador, Lebanon to Venezuela. And there are calls for the private sector - an industry worth $22 trillion - to give countries a payment holiday during this pandemic. 

In an op-ed in the Financial Times, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said private institutions are owed $18bn by the world's poorest nations this year. If they were to suspend half that amount, that would provide an additional $9bn to fight COVID-19. 

Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal, professor of banking and finance law and an expert in sovereign debt at Queen Mary University in London, shares his thoughts on whether it is time big finance gave poor nations debt relief to fight the pandemic.

Sharia-fintech and its bid for a big share of Indonesia's banking

Ramadan is a time not only for fasting in the Muslim world but also for charitable giving. Tech startups are finding ingenious ways to help ardent followers to part with their donations via a multitude of apps. 

This is particularly the case in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country with 270 million people, half of whom lack bank accounts but do have mobile phones.

But there is room for growth. All forms of Islamic banking account for just 6 percent of Indonesia's $580bn in banking assets. 

Hoping to get a bigger share of the Islamic finance market in Indonesia is Dima Djani, the chief executive of peer-to-peer lender ALAMI. Djani discusses Indonesia's banking with Al Jazeera.

Are the human rights of garment workers under threat?

The pandemic has had a disastrous impact on Southeast Asia's garment manufacturing hubs.

A million workers have been laid off, according to risk consultancy Maplecroft.

Forty million garment workers are employed by the industry in countries such as Cambodia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam. It is an important source of income. For example, the total value of exports for Bangladesh is $32bn.

The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association says factories have reported a loss of $3bn in orders. In Cambodia, garment workers are to be paid $70 a month from the government and employers. But that is 37 percent short of the current minimum wage.

Despite some factories reopening in Bangladesh, there are still fears that not enough is being done for people who live from pay cheque to pay cheque. And there are real fears that labour rights could unravel.

Sofia Nazalya, a human rights analyst at Maplecroft, shares her thoughts on whether the human rights of garment workers are under threat.

   <media:description>Prince Faisal bin Abdullah al-Saud, a son of Saudi Arabia's late monarch King Abdullah, has been in incommunicado detention since the end of March, according to a prominent rights group.
Human Rights Watch (HRW), citing a source with ties to the royal family, said on Saturday the prince was arrested by security forces on March 27 while self-isolating due to the coronavirus pandemic at a family compound northeast of the capital, Riyadh. 
In 2017, the prominent member of the royal family had been rounded up and detained at a luxury hotel in Riyadh, in what was billed as an attempt to combat corruption among the higher echelons of the kingdom's bureaucracy. Prince Faisal, a former head of the Saudi Red Crescent Society, was released later that year.
There was no immediate comment by Saudi authorities to the HRW's report.
Abdulaziz Almohaiyyad, a human rights activist, talks to Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>In our non-stop coverage of the media side of the coronavirus pandemic over the past few months, we have trained our lens on its more troubling aspects: From misinformation being spread by citizens, journalists and governments alike to the war of narratives being waged by great powers. 

But COVID-19 has also brought out the best in the fourth estate: People who are producing vital coverage, sometimes designed and delivered in new ways to help us understand a story laden with complexities.

In this special edition of The Listening Post, we track four path-breaking media projects from four different parts of the world, each of them using a different medium. 

From the United States and Brazil - countries whose presidents have repeatedly misinformed their electorates - Flo Phillips and Johanna Hoes hear from two medical experts-turned-broadcasters respectively; one through his podcast, the other over YouTube.

Later in the episode Daniel Turi takes us to Europe - virtually, of course - and a media aggregator that bypasses Silicon Valley's advertising-driven algorithms and onto smart COVID-19 analysis you might otherwise miss.

But Meenakshi Ravi starts the programme where the coronavirus story began, in China, where a Beijing-based magazine is proving that, even with the authorities ready to pounce, it can produce valuable journalism on the biggest news story of our time.

   <media:description>Wearing masks is now compulsory on public transport in Spain, as the government moves to relax its lockdown measures. 
But a lack of protective equipment has led to volunteers getting their sewing machines out to address the shortage.
