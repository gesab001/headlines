   <media:description>It's the world's largest economy and has enjoyed record growth. But it's collapsing. 
The U.S. economy could be facing its worst recession in decades triggered by covid-19 measures.
It shrank by almost 5% in the first quarter of this year. That's the biggest slide since the 2008 financial crisis.
Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and consumer spending has seen its biggest decline in forty years.
As many businesses are going bankrupt,  the U.S. has pumped more than two trillion dollars into the economy in the past six weeks. 
But many economists say this is not enough, and the worse is yet to come.
President Donald Trump says things will bounce back once the virus is contained.
The spillover is expected to inflict long term damage in the U.S. and around the world.
So, what can be done to reverse the crash?

   <media:description>The global coronavirus pandemic has changed the way Muslims around the world are observing the holy month of Ramadan.
In Iran, the foodservice industry has been hit hard.

Before the coronavirus outbreak, restaurants were already struggling. Months of political and economic unrest meant fewer customers.
 
Many small businesses have gone under and many more are on the verge of doing so.

   <media:description>While the Amazonian basin is most often touted for its biodiversity, there are also hundreds of indigenous tribes that live in the rainforest. Many of these tribes are under direct threat of displacement by resource extraction and deforestation. To this day, 70 percent of the Ecuadorian Amazon has been leased to oil companies, and plans have been set to auction off more land.

One of these areas includes a large swath of Waorani territory, labelled Block 22 by the Ecuadorian government. The territory is home to 18 roadless Waorani communities, including hundreds of medicinal plants, hunting routes, cemeteries, battlegrounds, watering holes, and a huge diversity of flora and fauna.

Six years ago, the Waorani decided that they needed to map their territory as a means not only to prove their rightful ownership of the land but also to document the rich biodiversity of their territory and the wisdom of Waorani elders for future generations. Over four years, the Waorani used hi-tech GPS technology, camera traps, and drones to map out 180,000 hectares of their territory. The maps include almost 10,000 GPS points.

Oswando Nenquimo, a native to one of the communities in Block 22, has dedicated himself fully to the project. He travels between the 52 Waorani communities, teaching GPS techniques and facilitating the mapping process. Just like most of the population, Oswando is adamant that the story of Waorani land be told by its own people. As the threat of deforestation and potential displacement continues, Oswando and the Waorani people plan to continue mapping as it is an important tool to fight natural resource extraction in their territory.

In November 2018, the Ecuadorian government paused their current plans to auction off Block 22, but the fight was far from over. In 2019, The Waorani decided to file a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government, which they later won on April 26th, protecting half a million acres of land in the Amazon forest, on which the Waorani have lived for centuries, guaranteeing the continued protection of their land from being earmarked for oil drilling.

   <media:description>Afghanistan's healthcare system has been battered by decades of conflict and political instability.

The new coronavirus pandemic is putting more strain on its medical workers.

Now, the government is releasing prisoners to stop the virus from spreading in its cramped prisons and to prevent hospitals from becoming even more overwhelmed.

President Jair Bolsonaro fired the previous boss last week.
As Al Jazeera's Latin America editor Lucia Newman reports, the ruling is the latest in a series of political blows for Bolsonaro.

   <media:description>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is being accused of unfairly singling out the Hasidic Jewish community, in enforcing COVID-19 restrictions.

He personally called on police to disperse hundreds of mourners, who gathered for a rabbi's funeral, defying social distancing rules.

He was furious the gathering took place at all, and mentioned the Jewish community by name in a tweet, saying the time for warnings has passed and arrests would be made of those who gather in large groups.

Some called for the mayor to apologize, resign, or called him anti-Jewish. Saying it was unfair for him to single out all Jews when it was just some from the Hasidic Orthodox community who gathered for the funeral. But the issue divided New York: Others expressed support for the mayor, and defended him calling out the funeral gathering.

On Wednesday the mayor said he was not trying to single out the Jewish community, but did not back down from his criticism.

 
The Hasidic Jewish community in New York does not need to look too far to see the dangers of large gatherings and contracting coronavirus. The rabbi whose funeral everyone was at died from it. 

Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo has more from New York.
