In early April, Mishali's shop was one of the first four in the city of Los Angeles criminally charged for refusing to shut down during the quarantine as city officials deemed the smoke shop a non-essential business. Mishali claimed for weeks that her store should have been allowed to operate as an essential business since it sold dry goods, paper products and cleaning supplies. The city eventually confirmed to her that she was in violation of state law. ({Dania Maxwell} / {Los Angeles Times})]]></media:description>

During a typical 10-hour shift, she treats appendicitis, overdoses, skateboard accidents, arrhythmia, the usual off-the-street accidents, illnesses and conditions that flare up without notice. With more than 10 years at the hospital, she knows what to expect and how to treat it, but the coronavirus has changed that. She treats about 20 patients a day who arrive with coughs, fevers, shortness of breath and the fear and uncertainty that this pandemic has brought.
