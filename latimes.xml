        <description><![CDATA[<p>The November contest between Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey and former San Francisco Dist. Atty. George Gascón to oversee the nation's largest prosecutor's office has been framed as a test of appetites for criminal justice reform.</p>]]></description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[With debates about criminal justice reform and police accountability buzzing across the country, the race for Los Angeles County's next top prosecutor may be one of the most important on the ballot in Southern California this November.Jackie Lacey, the county's first Black district attorney and a career prosecutor backed by local law enforcement, is seeking a third term in office, but she will have to fend off a challenge from former San Francisco Dist. Atty. George Gascón, who is considered one of the key figures in a push to elect more progressive prosecutors across the U.S. The race is seen as a referendum on what 21st century criminal justice should look like, one that's been exacerbated after a summer that saw large-scale opposition to the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the shooting of Jacob Blake. Lacey has been faulted by activists for her perceived hesitance to charge police in controversial killings, but Gascón has faced questions about his own record of not filing such charges during his eight years in San Francisco. You can review The Times' coverage of the race here.]]></content:encoded>

The average stay for a detainee is 29 days. The facility is managed by the private GEO Group. ICE detains an average of 33,000 undocumented immigrants in more than 400 facilities nationwide.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - AUGUST 20, 2020 - - Reporter and multimedia journalist Susie Plascencia uncovered that La Chingona Canabis' bio had been fabricated and the company was owned mostly by white men who are being accused of culturally appropriating Mexican culture. They presented La Chingona Cannabis as a rarity in the cannabis industry stating it was a woman-owned, Latinx business built with traditional medicinal techniques that the founders, three sisters from Guadalajara, Mexico, learned from their grandmother and generations past. But it was all a lie. So Plascencia and Freelance Cannabis Designer Savina Monet, from Oregon, started a social media boycott, #ChingalaChingona, to bring the truth to light and hold the company accountable for deceiving the cannabis and Mexican-American communities. The owner now claims the company has dismantled due to their efforts. Plasencia was photographed at El Pueblo de Los Angeles on August 20, 2020.

Kobe Bryant's widow Vanessa Bryant has sued the owner of the helicopter that crashed in fog and killed her husband and her 13-year-old daughter last month. The wrongful death lawsuit filed by Vanessa Bryant in Los Angeles says the pilot was careless and negligent by flying in cloudy conditions and should have aborted the flight. The pilot was among the nine people killed in the crash. The lawsuit was filed as a public memorial service for Kobe Bryant and his daughter was being held at the arena where Bryant played most of his career.(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)]]></media:description>
