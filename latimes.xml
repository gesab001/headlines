Boies is is planning to open her store for curbside pick-up tomorrow. "We'll see how it goes. I'll be here," Boies said about opening her business for curbside pick-up. She's really struggling. She's owned the clothing store on Abbott Kinney for the past 17 years. Her landlord is cutting her some slack right now on paying rent and she's waiting for an SBA loan. She's applied for unemployment for a small business loan and but does not qualify for a PPP loan because she is the sole person who runs the store. Retail businesses, such as book stores, clothing stores, toy stores and florists, can reopen for curbside pickup starting Friday. In order to do so, they are being asked to develop contactless payment procedures, have hand sanitizer available for employees and customers, ensure employees have proper protective gear, and ask employees to deliver goods to customers' cars when possible.

Boies is is planning to open her store for curbside pick-up tomorrow. "We'll see how it goes. I'll be here," Boies said about opening her business for curbside pick-up. She's really struggling. She's owned the clothing store on Abbott Kinney for the past 17 years. Her landlord is cutting her some slack right now on paying rent and she's waiting for an SBA loan. She's applied for unemployment for a small business loan and but does not qualify for a PPP loan because she is the sole person who runs the store. Retail businesses, such as book stores, clothing stores, toy stores and florists, can reopen for curbside pickup starting Friday. In order to do so, they are being asked to develop contactless payment procedures, have hand sanitizer available for employees and customers, ensure employees have proper protective gear, and ask employees to deliver goods to customers' cars when possible.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[Even in the most optimistic future under COVID-19, live music will be one of the last things to return to normal. When it does — and it will eventually — shows will be profoundly different. Beloved venues may have closed for good, crowds will be wary of each other on dancefloors and digital life may have supplanted sweaty clubs and sunny festival fields.Since The Times started documenting the fallout of COVID-19 for the music industry, the news has often been dire. The concert business is decimated for now, and everyone from wedding bands to record store clerks are terrified of the next few months. But public health experts believe there is a path forward to return eventually. Artists have turned to livestreaming in ingenious, sometimes hilarious ways to stay afloat (and sane). Music, as always, finds a way to be heard.We hear from readers every day about how much they miss the heartbeat of L.A. nightlife. Until it returns in all its close-quartered, ear-splitting glory, just imagine how good that first cold drink on a hot festival field will taste. We'll get back there someday.]]></content:encoded>

Boies is is planning to open her store for curbside pick-up tomorrow. "We'll see how it goes. I'll be here," Boies said about opening her business for curbside pick-up. She's really struggling. She's owned the clothing store on Abbott Kinney for the past 17 years. Her landlord is cutting her some slack right now on paying rent and she's waiting for an SBA loan. She's applied for unemployment for a small business loan and but does not qualify for a PPP loan because she is the sole person who runs the store. Retail businesses, such as book stores, clothing stores, toy stores and florists, can reopen for curbside pickup starting Friday. In order to do so, they are being asked to develop contactless payment procedures, have hand sanitizer available for employees and customers, ensure employees have proper protective gear, and ask employees to deliver goods to customers' cars when possible.
