Nearby Boyle Heights residents have long complained for about stomach-churning odors wafting over from five Vernon-area rendering plants, which take animal parts from slaughterhouses and cook them down into fats and proteins that are used to make pet food, fertilizer, cosmetics and products. The new standards, which took over three years for regulators to develop amid pushback from the industry, will require facilities enclose some of their outdoor animal processing operations, use odor-control equipment and take other steps to minimize offensive odors.

Nearby Boyle Heights residents have long complained for about stomach-churning odors wafting over from five Vernon-area rendering plants, which take animal parts from slaughterhouses and cook them down into fats and proteins that are used to make pet food, fertilizer, cosmetics and products. The new standards, which took over three years for regulators to develop amid pushback from the industry, will require facilities enclose some of their outdoor animal processing operations, use odor-control equipment and take other steps to minimize offensive odors.

Nearby Boyle Heights residents have long complained for about stomach-churning odors wafting over from five Vernon-area rendering plants, which take animal parts from slaughterhouses and cook them down into fats and proteins that are used to make pet food, fertilizer, cosmetics and products. The new standards, which took over three years for regulators to develop amid pushback from the industry, will require facilities enclose some of their outdoor animal processing operations, use odor-control equipment and take other steps to minimize offensive odors.
