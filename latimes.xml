The stadium is the first football stadium to be built within Los Angeles in Nearly 100 years. "We are in the team business, and you can't get to a moment like today without a great team. I would like to thank the 17,000 people who have worked on this project over the past four years," said Rams Owner/Chairman Stan Kroenke. "During a period of unrest and change in many parts of the country, it's been our deepest privilege to work on a project this special with such a diverse workforce. Thank you for making our vision a reality." SoFi Stadium is the first indoor-outdoor stadium and seats approximately 70,000, expandable up to 100,000.
