The tension across America is increasing after two months of coronavirus shutdowns and more than a week of destructive protests over the death of George Floyd. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) discusses the nationwide demonstrations and President Trump's vow to put soldiers on the ground if the violence doesn't stop. The Arizona Republican also weighs in on the possibility of another stimulus bill and her bid for re-election.

The civil unrest erupting across the country following the death of George Floyd is likely to slow the U.S. economy's comeback from the COVID-19 outbreak. Violent protests and looting in cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have left business owners in a tough place. Fox's Neil Cavuto joins the Rundown to weigh in on all of this and more.

Plus, commentary by &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; co-anchor and &quot;The Brian Kilmeade Show&quot; host, Brian Kilmeade.

The FOX News Rundown is a news-based daily morning podcast. Each morning, Jacqui Heinrich, Dave Anthony, Lisa Brady, Jessica Rosenthal and Chris Foster take a deep dive into the major and controversial stories of the day, tapping into the massive reporting resources of FOX News to provide a full picture of the news.

Check us out each morning.
