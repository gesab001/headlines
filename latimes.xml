    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[ENCINITAS, CA - AUGUST 04: Jim Brady, center, CEO of AToN, a rehab company that he started with his wife, Patricia Brady, left, more than a decade ago, and their daughter, Pat, chief operating officer, at the AToN Center, a luxury drug and alcohol addiction treatment center in Encinitas Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2020. As the coronavirus charted its deadly path across the country, Brady decided to temporarily stop accepting clients from some East Coast hot spots and drastically cut client capacity so patients didn't have to share bathrooms. Before long, he was losing a ton of money but he was determined not to layoff any employees. Instead, he applied for and got a PPP loan for about $800,000 from the federal government to cover payroll and a few other things. The experience of accepting government funds has prompted Brady to rethink some of his views on government aid - something he never expected to need. But now that he's watched the positive ripple effect of having received the loan - how it helped him, his family, his employees and their families - his more rigid views of government assistance have started to evolve. "I have a very different eye to that now. I've now dipped into the pie." (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

And within extended families, people tend to appoint a representative who is the only person to venture outside buying groceries, running errands or attending to urgent matters.
