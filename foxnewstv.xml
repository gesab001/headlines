Democrats officially nominated former Vice President Joe Biden to be their presidential nominee during the second night of the Democratic National Convention Tuesday. Speakers including Dr. Jill Biden, former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, former Secretary of State John Kerry and many others attempted to make the case that the Democratic presidential nominee's leadership will unite America and get the country out of the current crises and into a better future. FOX News Radio's National Correspondent Jared Halpern and FOX News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar recap night two with Director of the Fox News Decision Desk, Arnon Mishkin.

Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose discuss how they're preparing for this unprecedented Election Day and ensuring any ballot mailed is counted.

Plus, commentary by author and the vice president of communications for Focus on the Family Paul Batura.
