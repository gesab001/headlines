   <media:description>Officials in Buffalo, New York, want an investigation into the firing of a black police officer who intervened when a white colleague had a suspect in a chokehold.
The incident happened in November 2006. At the time, Officer Cariol Horne had served 19 of the 20 years needed to receive her pension, a spokesperson for Horne told CNN.
But Horne was fired for intervening and did not qualify for her pension, the city said.
&quot;The message was sent that you don't cross that blue line and so some officers -- many officers don't,&quot; said Horne in an interview with CNN's Brianna Keilar.

   <media:description>Burke County, Georgia, Sheriff Alfonzo Williams says that based on his experience in law enforcement and what he's seen so far on the videos, the officers involved in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks acted properly and their actions are &quot;completely justified.&quot; Sheriff Williams also said this case was very different than the Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd cases.

   <media:description>Whether President Donald Trump wins a second term in 2020 or not, it's virtually impossible to imagine him or the movement he created disappearing anytime soon. Chris Cillizza explains how Trump may never allow for an heir.

   <media:description>A Minnesota police officer could have shot an armed teen early, and though the officer would've been completely justified, he held his fire, St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson said.
The officer was shot during a struggle, Anderson said, but neither he nor his partner shot back and the suspect was arrested.
Following the incident, residents on the south side of the city heard via social media that police shot two black men, and about 100 marchers damaged property on their way to the police station, Anderson said at a news conference. He was joined by an NAACP official, a local pastor and the mayor.
&quot;We had information that when they arrived here their intent was to damage property and take over our police station. That didn't happen,&quot; the chief said. &quot;It is abhorrent to me. ... This place could've been on fire over a lie -- not just some misinformation, not just a few facts here and there. It was flat-out untrue.&quot;
The incident came just three weeks after police in Minneapolis, about an hour's drive southeast, killed George Floyd, setting off nationwide protests.
Pastor James Alberts of Higher Ground Church of God and Christ in St. Cloud appeared alongside Anderson to say the anger over Floyd's killing -- and the long-raging &quot;pandemic&quot; of racism -- is justified, but the St. Cloud police showed that &quot;it is possible to police and not kill.&quot;
&quot;The community is rightfully concerned, but there's no one dead here today. We're thankful that no one has died,&quot; he said.

   <media:description>Atlanta Police Department released the 9-11 call that was made by from the Wendy's parking lot where Rayshard Brooks got into an altercation with police and was later shot and killed.
Police responded to a call  about a man sleeping in a car at a Wendy's drive-thru and began talking with Brooks, who agreed to pull over. Authorities said he failed a sobriety test.
One of the officers tried to arrest him, which led to a struggle between Brooks and two officers, footage of the incident shows. Brooks took an officer's Taser during the struggle and then pointed it at one of the officers as he ran away. That officer then fatally shot Brooks.
Family attorneys, the district attorney and the mayor said the Brooks should not have been killed. For more than 20 minutes, Brooks responded to questions calmly and complied with officers' requests before they tried to arrest him.
&quot;It's very difficult when you see (the video), when you see the demeanor of Mr. Brooks, to imagine that some short time later, it ends up with him being dead,&quot; Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard.

   <media:description>CNN's Jeffrey Toobin explains why Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's first nominee to the Supreme Court, decided to deliver an opinion that will change how more than 7 million LGBTQ individuals will live and work in the United States.
It is a watershed moment from an unlikely author that means gay, lesbian and transgender workers are protected by federal civil rights law. It is a stunning defeat for judicial conservatives who worked to ensure Gorsuch's nomination and Republicans, including Donald Trump, who stymied President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, liberal Merrick Garland in 2016.
The ruling puts Gorsuch in the history books.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Gorsuch wrote, which bars discrimination &quot;because of sex,&quot; also covers claims based on sexual orientation and gender identity
