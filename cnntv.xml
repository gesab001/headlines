   <media:description>In 2016, the vast majority of political insiders gave Donald Trump a very slim chance of winning, which is a fact he likes to remind people often. This is why people do not like to make assessments of the President's current dismal political position. Chris Cillizza explains why this is a mistake in 2020.

   <media:description>President Donald Trump said  he will &quot;surge&quot; federal law enforcement officers to Chicago and Albuquerque, despite resistance from local leaders, as he adopts a hardline &quot;law and order&quot; mantle ahead of November's election.
In making the move, Trump is wading further into an effort to portray Democrats as weak on crime and unable to protect the citizens of places where they are in charge. He has ordered federal agents to tamp down on protests in Portland, Oregon, leading to chaotic tableaux and reports of unmarked vehicles snatching people off the streets. And he has warned he may order federal officers into other states and cities he deems insufficiently policed, even if governors and mayors in those places don't ask for help.
His attention in recent days has focused on Chicago, whose Democratic mayor said Tuesday she would not allow &quot;Donald Trump's troops&quot; into her city. Before he became president, Trump once railed against his predecessor for high crime rates in Chicago, but he now blames local officials for the scourge.
Using ominous rhetoric and dark language to describe cities run by Democrats as rife with crime and violence, Trump suggested Wednesday he had little option but to take steps those leaders haven't to save innocent lives.

   <media:description>Republicans in the Senate are roundly dismissing President Donald Trump's call to withhold more federal aid from schools that remain shuttered during the coronavirus pandemic, the latest sign of a split between the White House and the GOP over their party's response to the public health emergency.
&quot;I'm not a big fan of doing anything where the federal government impacts local, state governments or schools,&quot; Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, said. &quot;I want schools to reopen, but I don't like that. I don't like the federal government getting involved.&quot;
As negotiations within the party continued , GOP senators made clear there were a number of White House demands that they unlikely were going to embrace, including the President's demands to cut payroll taxes and to pull back on funding for coronavirus testing and tracing.
&quot;I don't think anybody's satisfied with it,&quot; said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, when asked about testing in the US, something that Trump has frequently touted.
Others were more critical of the Trump administration's handling of the crisis.
&quot;I don't think it's been a great example for the world to see America,&quot; Utah Sen. Mitt Romney said of the President's handling of the pandemic, pointing to the lack of rapid and accessible testing as well as shortages of personal protective equipment.
As the US struggles to get a handle of the crisis, Republicans are struggling themselves to find consensus over their latest recovery plan, a measure that is expected to cost roughly $1 trillion and will serve as an alternative to the $3 trillion Democratic bill that passed the House more than two months ago. Many Republicans, including those up for reelection, are eager for another relief package to help millions of jobless Americans and bolster the US response to the crisis.

   <media:description>Fifteen people were shot in a drive-by shooting in Chicago at a funeral for a victim of another drive-by shooting, Chicago Police said.
Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown that rival gang factions were repeating a cycle of violence and revenge.
&quot;We can't keep meting out violence with violence,&quot; Brown said. &quot;An eye for an eye makes us both blind. It's destroying our families and perpetuates this endless cycle of gunshot victims night after night.&quot;
Two of the people shot at the funeral are men &quot;known to police,&quot; Chicago Police said. Both are in their 30s and are listed in serious condition, said CPD.
Of the injured, all of whom are adults, 14 were hospitalized. One person is in extremely critical condition and another is in critical condition, according to police. Police say the others who were injured in this shooting are expected to recover.
The oldest victim, a 65-year-old woman, was treated on scene and is in good condition, police said. There is a person of interest being questioned by police, CPD said.
The shooting is just the latest in a spate of gun violence in Chicago and in major cities across the United States in the past few months that coincide with the end of Covid-19-related lockdowns, mass protests against police violence and summertime, when crime annually increases.

   <media:description>President Donald Trump that he wishes Ghislaine Maxwell &quot;well,&quot; as she faces charges for recruiting, grooming and ultimately sexually abusing minors as young as 14 as Jeffrey Epstein's alleged accomplice.
&quot;I just wish her well, frankly,&quot; Trump said during a White House press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump acknowledged that he has met Maxwell &quot;numerous times&quot; over the years, but said he hasn't been following her case.
The President was also asked whether he believes Maxwell will turn on powerful men, including Prince Andrew, who has faced public pressure to explain his relationship with Epstein and one of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Giuffre has alleged that she was forced into sexual encounters with the prince while she was underage.
rump replied on Maxwell, &quot;I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly. I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach. I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well. Whatever it is. I don't know the situation with Prince Andrew. Just don't know. Not aware of it.&quot;
