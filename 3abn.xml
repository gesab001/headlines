   <media:description>Live church sermon produced by 3ABN with Pastor Kenny Shelton. As fear and uncertainty spread and a war wages against the Coronavirus pestilence, it appears something much bigger is happening.  In the darkest dimensions of earth the Devil constructs ways to destroy God's people and bring his control over the world. Will we lose our freedom's? Is time up? What will the result be of the trials upon the earth and each person?  Even though the church doors are closed and the health of the world's population declines, God has a way out. Bible prophecy is being fulfilled right now. 

Join us for this episode of Worship Hour as we study the Word of God and find answers to important questions with Pastor Kenny Shelton.

   <media:description>Sunday Law is a Bible prophecy topic familiar to some. But, whether or not you are familiar with what the Sunday Law is all about, a movement for Sunday sacredness is happening. Recent events occurring in the world reassure us that we are living in the last days of earth's history. 

The books of Daniel and Revelation teach us about how the Antichrist will work to bring upon this world the Mark of the Beast.  How do the powers of this world play into the law making of such a theme? Watch and listen to this live church sermon produced by 3ABN with Pastor Ryan Day. 

Join us for this episode of Worship Hour as we study the Word of God and find answers to important questions.

   <media:description>Live church sermon produced by 3ABN with Pastor John Lomacang. The whole world is in quarantine, some to more a degree than others. A lock-down in an attempt to control a worldwide pandemic. In this time of waiting, many have been forced to turn from their usual activities. Some of these changes have resulted in human suffering. What do you do when everything that you've trusted in and relied on is suddenly gone?

Could it be that God is letting judgment come to the earth as punishment, or as a warning? Does God even have anything to do with all this? The Bible gives us light on the subject. It shows us the measures God took in the past so that His people could remain in safety. It also tells us what He will do in the future and how you can stay spiritually connected during this time. Join us for this episode of Worship Hour as we study the Word of God and find answers to these important questions.
