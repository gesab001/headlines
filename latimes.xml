Funeral homes are claiming that bureaucratic delays in obtaining death certificates and disposition permits for burials and cremations, further increase family stress when grieving the death of a loved one, but impacts immigrant families even more, because it prevents families from returning their loved ones to their home countries. The group is announcing they will no longer remove Covid-19 bodies from hospitals, convalescents and hospices, until the issues are addressed by state and local agencies, including the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors.
