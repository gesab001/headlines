   <media:description>Content warning: Some viewers may find this film distressing

Watch Part 1 here: https://youtu.be/F65Mc3oBylk

Six years ago, Catherine Corless, a local historian from County Galway in the Republic of Ireland, discovered that hundreds of babies and young children had died in a home for unmarried pregnant women, run by Roman Catholic nuns in her hometown of Tuam.

Further research revealed that many of the babies had died of malnutrition and other forms of neglect. Most of their bodies had been disposed of, officially unrecorded, in an old septic tank buried in the grounds of the home.

Angry survivors and relatives called for an investigation - for the remains to be exhumed, identified and properly buried, for compensation and immediate government action. Concerned families began to ask questions about other homes run by the Church in Ireland and how many other babies had died in equally mysterious circumstances.

In 2015, in response to publicity and pressure in Dail Eireann, the lower house of the Irish Parliament, the government announced it was setting up an official Commission of Investigation. The body was required to provide answers by 2018. Indeed, some modest interim findings have since been released, but two years since its official publication date, the full report has still not seen the light of day.

This June, partially in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the report was again delayed until October 2020.

In its absence, the suspicion, frustration and anger of relatives have mushroomed. And the once shameful secret of a single small rural town is developing into a broader and more profound national scandal; an affair which goes to the heart of the close relationship between successive Irish governments and the Catholic Church.

In two special episodes of People and Power, from filmmakers Callum Macrae, Mark Williams and Al Jazeera correspondent Laurence Lee, we investigate deeply disturbing allegations that both the Irish state and its religious orders were responsible for a systematic decades-long regime of institutional neglect and exploitation involving the death of thousands of children.

   <media:description>Across the United States, cases of COVID-19 continue to proliferate and the start of the new school year is just around the corner. 

Students, teachers and parents have started planning the return but what school should now look like has become a contentious - and politicised - issue. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued a statement in favour of bringing children back to the classroom this Autumn if it can be done safely. 

&quot;Science and community circumstances must guide decision-making and funding is critical,&quot; it said.

The Centers for Disease Control has also published a document outlining health protocols that should be followed.

But many teachers say this is not enough. Their representative organisations have said schools may remain closed if funding is not made available to pay for appropriate safety precautions.

With just four months until a presidential election, US President Donald Trump is pushing hard for life to return to normal. But most education policy in the US is determined at the state and local level, and not by the federal government.

Global data suggests that children are far less likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus than adults. But there are unanswered questions, including how often children become infected and what role they play in transmitting the virus. Given that, several experts advise caution. 

In this episode of The Stream, we take a look at both sides of the debate and ask a panel of experts whether compromises can be made to ensure American children have access to the best education possible.

   <media:description>Former Soviet republics Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region for decades.

Both countries accuse each other of triggering the latest artillery bombardment and drone attacks north of the disputed region.
Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has sacked the foreign minister, accusing him of 'meaningless negotiations' with Armenia.
Can the two sides resolve decades of animosity?

Presenter: Imran Khan

   <media:description>The fortunes of the American airline industry nosedived when coronavirus cases hit the United States.  
Airlines were given a bailout worth $25bn in exchange for an agreement to not lay off workers. 
But that deal ends in September and one airline has already announced massive cuts.

   <media:description>It has been 25 years since the Amazon website went online.
What started as a garage-based bookseller, struggling to break into an emerging online marketplace, has grown into the world's largest retailer, with a market value of $1.1 trillion.
This year, Amazon became not just convenient, but essential for millions of people surviving the coronavirus pandemic.
About $11,000 worth of goods is sold on Amazon’s e-commerce platform every second. 
Three and a half billion packages were delivered last year - one for every two people on the planet.
And Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing division, enables more than 100 million people to make Zoom calls a day and a similar number to watch Netflix.
But the giant company is not without problems. 
Some politicians think it is too big and powerful and want to see it broken up. 
Questions are also being raised about worker mistreatment.

Mary Anderson-Ford, retail specialist and managing director at AQUAretail, talks to Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>An estimated 150,000 Filipino nurses work in the US, earning up to 30 times more than they could back home.

But at what cost?

Many nurses work long hours, some juggling multiple jobs to support their families. Others are exploited, intimidated and forced into indentured labour.

Now Filipino nurses are on the front lines of New York's COVID-19 crisis, some losing their lives as they battle to keep Americans alive. Meanwhile, the Philippines is facing a dire shortage of medical workers at this critical time.

101 East investigates the price of chasing the American Dream.

   <media:description>The United States says it is ready to support countries that believe China's territorial claims in the South China Sea are illegal.
It comes after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the US does not recognise most of Beijing's claims in the strategically important region.
It is a decision that has been welcomed by fishermen in the Philippines who are being pushed out of their usual fishing spots by the Chinese navy.

Al Jazeera's Jamela Alindogan reports from Zambales province, the Philippines.

   <media:description>The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) shows that many of the world’s top vacation destinations have eased travel restrictions. 
Mexico, one of the world’s top vacation destinations, is among those reopening their doors. This, despite the country’s continuing struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Industry experts predict it could take years for Mexico's tourism to recover.
