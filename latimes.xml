California government workers get cheap rent for state property, taxpayers foot the maintenance. Parks employees continue to rent two Crystal Cove cottages. Cottage 17 is steps from the beach, an 1,100 square foot home featuring French windows and wood siding. It was restored in 2006 as employee housing and rents for $232 a month. A second cottage, #21, is rented to a park employee for $395 a month. Similar cottages are available to the public for $261 a night, and those are booked as much as seven months in advance. (Allen J.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[LONG BEACH, CA - December 10: Bikers not wearing masks pass by Long Beach's health ambassadors Chris Bonomo, right center, who has had COVID-19 before and sees the importance in educating and reminding others, Ezequiel Gutierrez, 18, and Pablo Razo, 18, in background at left, as they check on the bike path to make sure people are complying with the current COVID-19 rules and restrictions at Shoreline Village in Long Beach Thursday, Dec. 10, 2020. The city hired 13 youth in partnership with Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network in July to make sure people are following social distancing and mask mandates. They go around busy parks, beaches and streets, handing out masks to people. Long Beach City Council is considering ramping up enforcement for people who are not wearing masks and how it has been handling the pandemic lately, since the city has its own public health department, apart from LA County. The LBPD came under scrutiny recently after the Long Beach Post published a story showing pictures of a police training in early November where dozens of police officers were gathered close together, many not wearing masks. The community ambassadors reminded them about the safer at home order, bringing hand sanitizer, not to come to the park sick, maintain 6 feet distance with people outside of your household, anybody 2 years or older is required to wear a mask, wash hands frequently, and that nobody is allowed to gather with people outside of their household.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[BURBANK, CA - NOVEMBER 08: A view of three of the five books the Burbank Unified School District removed from in-class instruction because of the alleged harm they can cause to the district's Black students. The titles are "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," "The Cay," "To Kill a Mockingbird," "Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry" and "Of Mice and Men." A committee of parents, teachers and principals was created to review the complaints against the books and decide next steps. Chloe Bauer remembers the powerful impact reading "Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry" had on her when she was a student at John Muir Middle School: it taught her about America's racist history and she believes the novel should remain required reading for Burbank Unified's middle school students. Sungjoo Yoon launched a petition against the books' removal and corralled 80 student statements decrying the district's consideration to permanently remove the books from in-class instruction.
