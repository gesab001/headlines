He said the trees have stopped regenerating, and their lofty, alpine domain is being invaded by pines usually found at warmer, lower elevations. Climate change has made it easier for Limber pine seeds carried to higher elevations by birds to thrive in the Inyo National Forest on September 20, 2017 in Inyo County, California.(Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
