This week, thousands of Americans protested police brutality after the death of George Floyd. As violence erupted in areas like New York, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., President Trump was met with criticism of his handling and response to the protests. Hogan Gidley, Deputy Assistant to the President and Principal Deputy Press Secretary, defends the White House’s response to the riots, the president's support for black Americans and if the White House is concerned about a second wave of coronavirus infections following the nationwide protests. 

The United States has seen better days. As businesses start to re-open, we are still seeing close to 1,000 Americans dying each day. Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, discusses what he thinks was a bad week for America as well as President Trump.
