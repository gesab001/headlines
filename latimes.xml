    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[ENCINITAS, CA - AUGUST 04: Jim Brady, center, CEO of AToN, a rehab company that he started with his wife, Patricia Brady, left, more than a decade ago, and their daughter, Pat, chief operating officer, at the AToN Center, a luxury drug and alcohol addiction treatment center in Encinitas Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2020. As the coronavirus charted its deadly path across the country, Brady decided to temporarily stop accepting clients from some East Coast hot spots and drastically cut client capacity so patients didn't have to share bathrooms. Before long, he was losing a ton of money but he was determined not to layoff any employees. Instead, he applied for and got a PPP loan for about $800,000 from the federal government to cover payroll and a few other things. The experience of accepting government funds has prompted Brady to rethink some of his views on government aid - something he never expected to need. But now that he's watched the positive ripple effect of having received the loan - how it helped him, his family, his employees and their families - his more rigid views of government assistance have started to evolve. "I have a very different eye to that now. I've now dipped into the pie." (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
