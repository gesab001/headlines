    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[HANFORD, CA - NOVEMBER 16, 2020 - Tina Perez holds a photo of her daughter Adora Perez in Hanford, California on November 16, 2020. Adora has been in prison for nearly three years after she gave birth to a stillborn baby and prosecutors charged her with murder, alleging her meth use was to blame. Perez took a deal in which she pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 11 years because she thought it was the only way to avoid a potential life sentence. The ACLU has launched a new push to free her, saying ineffective legal counsel led to the verdict because her lawyer overlooked serious flaws in her case and never told her that her conduct might not be a crime in California. That's despite the fact Perez paid the woman $15,000 to represent her, according to her family. A pro bono lawyer retained by the ACLU has now filed a legal motion seeking to have an appeal of her case reopened. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

Brother Dennis writes inmates letters in longhand that he visited before the pandemic struck. "It's truly a labor of love," said Brother Dennis about writing the letters. At a time when public visits to jails and prisons have been suspended, some chaplains have felt an extra sense of responsibility to stay connected to the inmates. Brother Dennis Gibbs and Sister Greta Ronningen have decided not to go into correctional settings for safety reasons, but they've developed a steady correspondence with inmates and try to give them hope and support at a time when they are living in more isolation than usual.

Morriss, is a fifth generation Texan rancher, is trying to get her Brazilian husband, Falko Konig, to the U.S. However, Trump's immigration policies and COVID-19 has slowed down and pretty much halted an already glacially slow process. Trump has bogged down the process because he's moved much of the immigration personnel usually dedicated to spousal visas to focus on fraud. That's really slowed down the process. It used to be 9 to 12 months to get a spousal visa. After Trump, it's more like 12 to 15 months to get the same visa. In addition, COVID has shuttered many U.S. embassies, including the one in Brazil.]]></media:description>
