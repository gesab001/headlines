In early April, Mishali's shop was one of the first four in the city of Los Angeles criminally charged for refusing to shut down during the quarantine as city officials deemed the smoke shop a non-essential business. Mishali claimed for weeks that her store should have been allowed to operate as an essential business since it sold dry goods, paper products and cleaning supplies.

During a typical 10-hour shift, she treats appendicitis, overdoses, skateboard accidents, arrhythmia, the usual off-the-street accidents, illnesses and conditions that flare up without notice. With more than 10 years at the hospital, she knows what to expect and how to treat it, but the coronavirus has changed that. She treats about 20 patients a day who arrive with coughs, fevers, shortness of breath and the fear and uncertainty that this pandemic has brought.

County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA -- WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2020: Denise Martinez, of Costa Mesa, kneels down in prayer in front of the closed Huntington Beach pier as she spreads her message of love, not the anarchy that she says some of the stay-at-home protesters want. "I'm out here praying for the city," Martinez said. "And to show an example of Christ, who is love. Our freedom doesn't come from a spirit of anarchy. Right now our main focus is loving each other at any cost. The lord says today that he hears the cries of his people and to trust him. Because love overcomes everything." Beach-goers enjoyed warm summer-like weather amid state and city social distancing regulations to stave off Coronavirus mandated by Gov. Newsom in Huntington Beach, CA, on April 22, 2020. (Allen J.
