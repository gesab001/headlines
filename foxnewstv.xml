President Trump was nominated this week for a 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. The nomination comes from Christian Tybring-Gjedde who is a member of the Norwegian Parliament. Tybring-Gjedde joins FOX News Radio's White House Correspondent Jon Decker on the 'Rundown' to explain the nomination, why he thinks the agreement between Israel and the UAE is so significant and if he thinks the president's nomination could sway voters before the November election.

This coronavirus crisis has affected us all in a variety of ways. For many, it means finding a new place to live. A Pew Research survey found 22 percent of Americans have either moved temporarily or permanently.

Plus, commentary by FOX News Contributor Liz Peek.
