   <media:description>Multiple sclerosis (MS), an auto-immune disease, has no known cure.

Stem cell transplants are proving promising, but in most countries, this treatment is available only for those MS sufferers accepted into clinical trials.

In Russia, however, one doctor has already performed the treatment on thousands of patients, and now he is drawing people from as far away as Australia.

101 East follows the journey of an Australian man with MS who is trying to get to Moscow for a stem cell transplant, and another who has just had treatment and cannot get home after the COVID-19 pandemic shuts international borders.

   <media:description>Many reporters around the world face threats, intimidation and even physical attacks while on the job. But, in some cases, journalists have gone missing with little indication as to their whereabouts.

The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 64 journalists are missing globally. It is is now leading the #MissingNotForgotten campaign to highlight the cases of these journalists and pressure authorities to investigate their disappearance, especially in the time COVID, and to provide families with answers. 

Many of the missing reporters were working in Syria and Iraq. Since 2011, at least 137 journalists have been killed in Syria, while at least 189 have been killed in Iraq since 2003. Many more journalists and media workers have been forced into exile. Syria has the highest number of missing foreign journalists in the world.

The disappearances are not just confined to war zones and crime beats. Other cases highlighted by the CPJ include that of Haitian freelance photojournalist Vladjimir Legagneur, who was last seen by his wife in 2018 when he left the family home in Port-au-Prince. Daysi Lizeth Mina Huaman was last seen waiting for a bus in January, on her way to meet her boyfriend in the Peruvian city of Ayacucho. 

We’ll speak to the CPJ about their efforts to get answers about journalists missing around the world. We’ll also hear from family members who are desperate for answers.

   <media:description>The Kremlin has rejected accusations that Russia is responsible for the poisoning of Alexey Navalny.
That is after Germany said it has &quot;unequivocal proof&quot; the opposition figure was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent.
Navalny has been seriously ill in a Berlin hospital after collapsing on a flight in Russia two weeks ago.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said the poisoning was an attempt to murder and that only Russia could answer the serious questions raised.

   <media:description>Two decades ago, former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe violently evicted thousands of white farmers and gave the properties to black families.
Critics argue the policy destroyed the economy.
The government of Mugabe's successor Emmerson Mnangagwa says foreign white farmers can apply to have the land back.
It follows an agreement in July to pay 3.5 billion dollars in compensation.
Will these measures resolve one of the most divisive policies in Zimbabwe's history?

   <media:description>It has been 25 years since an e-commerce website called AuctionWeb appeared online. 

That was at the beginning of the dot-com bubble when the scope and reach of e-commerce as it is today could barely be imagined.

AuctionWeb became eBay. While largely eclipsed by Amazon, the company is still profitable, and its founder is branching out into new ventures he believes will help society and political discourse.

Al Jazeera's Rob Reynolds reports from Los Angeles in the United States.

   <media:description>Faced with a choice between Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican incumbent Donald Trump, Harvard University Professor Cornel West is not optimistic about real change coming to the United States.

For decades, West has been a forceful voice arguing that neither party cares for the poor and voiceless except when it is time to vote every four years.

Meanwhile, the demands of maintaining the American empire grow, and military budgets continue to rise at the expense of education and healthcare, hurting not only working Americans, but people around the world.

Dive into Cornel West's expansive world view with host Steve Clemons.

   <media:description>US President Donald Trump has suggested Americans should vote twice in the upcoming elections, despite it being illegal. 
Trump has been insisting, without evidence, that an increase in mail-in ballots would lead to widespread voter fraud.  
He is also threatening to cut off funding to cities where protesters are rallying against police violence on people of colour.
And he denied Black people are shot more than whites. 
Al Jazeera's Leah Harding has more.

   <media:description>At 11pm on June 30, 2020, a new national security law came into effect in Hong Kong - just an hour before the 23rd anniversary of Britain's handover of the city to China.

The legislation, which sparked an immediate international backlash, has significantly tightened Beijing's grip on Hong Kong and has stifled the huge protests that began sweeping the territory a year ago.

Demonstrators say they have been fighting for democracy. Beijing's supporters describe them as &quot;rioters&quot; and insist the law is needed to quell unrest.

But with activists now facing imprisonment, pro-democracy candidates disqualified from elections, and even a prominent media mogul detained by security police, many Hong Kongers fear that the principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; - which lay at the heart of the 1997 handover agreement with the UK and was supposed to ensure a degree of autonomy for 50 years - is now all but dead and buried.

Filmmakers Lynn Lee and James Leong have been finding out why.

   <media:description>A supporter of the QAnon movement, which believes that a so-called “Deep State” wants to bring down Donald Trump, is looking likely to be elected to the United States Congress this November.  
Marjorie Taylor Greene, who President Donald Trump calls a “future Republican star,” beat a conservative neurosurgeon in Georgia and will likely head to Congress.
It is another sign of the rise of the QAnon movement, which the FBI sees as a potential domestic terrorist threat.
It also associates Democrats with paedophiles and satanists.

   <media:description>Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez has announced new measures to help businesses survive the coronavirus pandemic. 
The economy is already into its third year of recession, and is expected to shrink even more this year.
That has left millions of people trying to prevent bankruptcy.

   <media:description>Student unions in Myanmar are urging people to boycott November's general election.

   <media:description>Bulgaria’s president Rumen Radev on Wednesday called on the government to step down, echoing the demands of protesters demanding the resignations of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and his cabinet over allegations they allowed an oligarchic mafia to seize control of the Balkan country.
Thousands protested outside parliament on Wednesday, in one of the biggest rallies in almost two months.
But the prime minister is trying to keep his job until elections in March.
