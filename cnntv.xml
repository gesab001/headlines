   <media:description>A powerful family. A deadly boating accident. Two mysterious slayings. Drug addiction, stolen money and a botched shooting in an alleged insurance fraud scheme.
It sounds like someone took a list of sordid elements and stuffed them all into a crime thriller so twisty it could only be fiction.
But the tortuous tale of the Murdaughs, a prominent South Carolina family with shadowy secrets, is real. And it's far from over.
The story took a fresh turn this week when investigators arrested patriarch Alex Murdaugh for allegedly hiring a hit man to kill him in a failed attempt to collect millions in life insurance for his surviving son, Buster. This came three months after Murdaugh's wife and other son were gunned down on the family's secluded estate.
These events led authorities to open investigations into several other mysterious deaths -- dating back years -- with apparent ties to the Murdaughs.
Now the family's legacy of influence is crumbling and the rural area around Hampton, some 75 miles west of Charleston, is buzzing with theories. The evolving saga has inspired at least one podcast and gripped amateur sleuths around the state -- and the nation.

   <media:description>CNN's Michael Smerconish says new revelations about the negative effects of Instagram and social media made him think about the case of Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old who has not been heard from since going on a road trip with her fiance.

   <media:description>Criminal investigators in Georgia have been quietly conducting interviews, collecting documents and working to build a line of communication with congressional investigators as they aim to build a case against former President Donald Trump for his alleged attempts to overturn the state's 2020 presidential election results.

   <media:description>A United States military investigation into a deadly Kabul drone strike on a vehicle in August has found it killed 10 civilians and the driver and that the vehicle targeted was likely not a threat associated with ISIS-K, announced Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top general of US Central Command, at the Pentagon on Friday.
McKenzie told reporters that the strike was a &quot;mistake&quot; and offered an apology.
&quot;This strike was taken in the earnest belief that it would prevent an imminent threat to our forces and the evacuees at the airport, but it was a mistake and I offer my sincere apology,&quot; he said.
McKenzie added that he is &quot;fully responsible for this strike and this tragic outcome.&quot;
The Pentagon had maintained that at least one ISIS-K facilitator and three civilians were killed in what Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley had previously called a &quot;righteous strike&quot; on the compound on August 29. The investigation released Friday found that all of those killed in the residential compound were civilians.
In the lead up to the strike, drone operators surveilled the courtyard for up to 4 to 5 minutes. In that time, a male driver left the vehicle. One child was parking the vehicle and other children were present in the car and the courtyard -- as CNN had been told by the Ahmadi family.

   <media:description>Mike Pence is adding staffers for his brand-new office in downtown Washington -- inching closer to a possible White House run even as his standing worsens with former President Donald Trump and his base of supporters.
The former vice president's ramp-up comes as Trump appears to be making good on his declaration to Pence that &quot;I don't want to be your friend anymore.&quot; That quote, first reported this week, is attributed to Trump in a forthcoming book by journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa.
The last conversation between the two Republican leaders was a phone call from Trump in April, Republican sources tell CNN, wishing Pence well as the former vice president recovered from heart surgery.
Pence isn't waiting to make up with his former running mate -- nor is he waiting for the former President to make up his own mind about his political future. People around Pence rejected the idea that he would hold off on his 2024 planning until Trump announces whether he'll run.
&quot;Mike is going to look at this and say, 'Where am I being called to serve?' &quot; said one person close to Pence. &quot;That's not going to be thwarted by any man or woman.&quot;
&quot;If he feels called to do this,&quot; the adviser went on, &quot;it's not going to be because of who else is in the race.&quot;

   <media:description>Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump earlier this year, announced Thursday that he will not run for reelection in 2022.
&quot;While my desire to build a fuller family life is at the heart of my decision, it is also true that the current state of our politics, especially many of the toxic dynamics inside our own party, is a significant factor in my decision,&quot; Gonzalez said in a statement.
Gonzalez had previously argued that Trump's rhetoric at the &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; rally ahead of the insurrection on January 6 and the fact that the former President did little to stop those actions swayed him to back the impeachment charges. That decision unearthed profound anger in his northeast Ohio district, kicking off a localized fight over the future of the Republican Party that pit the two-term congressman against irate constituents eager to expel any member of the party who crossed the former President.
Trump, for his part, campaigned against the lawmaker in June, rallying for primary opponent Max Miller, a former Trump aide, in his first return to the campaign trail after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.
Trump said in a statement Friday that Gonzalez &quot;decided to quit after enduring a tremendous loss of popularity&quot; following the impeachment vote.
Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, another one of the 10 House Republicans who voted for impeachment, said the former President's statement about Gonzalez &quot;reminds us all, once again, that Trump is at war with the Constitution.&quot;
The Ohio Republican Party Central Committee had voted in May to censure Gonzalez and call for his resignation.
A former NFL player first elected to the House in 2018, Gonzalez was one of only 35 House Republicans who voted later that month to establish an independent commission to investigate the insurrection, which Senate Republicans later blocked.

   <media:description>More than 9,500 migrants, many of them Haitians fleeing a country torn apart by a coup and an earthquake, have arrived at the US border and are living under a bridge near Texas. Thousands of additional migrants are expected to arrive at the border in the coming days. CNN's Rosa Flores got an exclusive aerial tour of the area.
