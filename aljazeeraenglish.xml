   <media:description>The UN's outgoing human rights envoy for Myanmar says the country's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has failed to live up to her reputation as a humanitarian.  
Her time in the role has been especially dominated by Myanmar's crackdown in Rakhine State in 2017. 
About 750,000 people, mostly Rohingya muslims, fled across the border to Bangaldesh. 
Now Yanghee Lee has told Al Jazeera that she believes Myanmar's army carried out ethnic cleansing. 
Al Jazeera's Wayne Hay reports.

   <media:description>Struggling to make ends meet and begging for food. Lebanese people have defied restrictions to contain covid-19, and resumed their protests.
Rallies started in October, but were interrupted by the lockdown. Violence escalated on Tuesday, banks were set on fire and security forces pelted with stones.
One demonstrator was killed and dozens were wounded in riots. Protesters vented their anger at the political elite that's long been in power.
People accuse their leaders of corruption and mismanagement. 
Lebanon is suffering its worst economic crisis in decades.
Food prices are soaring and the lebanese pound is in free-fall. 
The country's appealed for assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
As the country slips further into crisis, what can be done?
And what will be the fallout, both at home and for the region?

Presenter: Richelle Carey

   <media:description>One of the side-effects of the coronavirus pandemic has been a sharp drop in the price of oil.
That has led some oil companies to declare bankruptcy, and others to lay off thousands of workers.
It is creating a strange spectacle off the coast of California.

   <media:description>The coronavirus pandemic has made life even more difficult for domestic violence victims who have been forced to quarantine with their abusers. Around the world, stay-at-home orders and other social distancing restrictions are making it more difficult for victims to seek help and refuge from mental and physical harm. In some cases, access to counselors and safe houses have been suspended to comply with measures for social isolation.

What options do you have if you are on lockdown at home with your abuser? In this episode, we'll discuss what more should be done to help people facing domestic abuse during the pandemic.

   <media:description>The Arab Muslim world has a long tradition of songs and chants for the holy month of Ramadan. This film tells the fascinating behind-the-scenes stories of four popular pieces.
 
The song Ramadan Gana, or Here Comes Ramadan, is often played on TV to coincide with the start of Ramadan. Its simplicity, familiar lyrics and the singer’s warm voice make it hugely popular in the Arab world. 

Wahawi Ya Wahawi, or Welcome Ramadan Moon, was first performed by an Egyptian singer in the 1930s and later in a 1953 Egyptian movie by a five-year-old Lebanese girl, Hayam Younis, who still clearly remembers singing it. Decades on, she describes filming the song which became a timeless classic.

Mawlay, or My Lord God, is a religious chant derived from a prayer. Former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat encouraged the Sufi figure Sayed Naqshband to work with the famous Egyptian composer, Baligh Hamdi, whose speciality was love songs. Despite early misgivings they found common ground, and the result was a deeply spiritual chant.

Allou El Bayarek, or Hang Out Ramadan Flags, dates back to the Lebanese Civil War and was written for a children's choir at a Beirut orphanage. Composer Ahmed Kaboor had a vision of colourful flags, lights and lanterns hanging from every building.

This film is a rich mix of music, theology and social and cultural history, weaving together interviews and rare video archive to offer a different take on Ramadan.

   <media:description>Amid the threat of coronavirus in Latin America, the small Central American country of El Salvador is also dealing with another problem, the endemic violence that has made it one of the most murderous countries in the world in recent years.
It comes after the country saw its highest single-day homicide tally on Friday, with 22 people killed.
But extreme measures in the new crackdown on gang members in prison, including completely sealing off the prisons to allow no contact with the outside world, by President Nayib Bukele has proved deeply controversial

   <media:description>Al Jazeera has learned that the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have advanced plans for a mass prisoner exchange in Yemen, which could potentially take place in a matter of days.
It is part of a ceasefire proposed by the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths.
The first batch of prisoners to be released may comprise about 1,000 inmates.

Al Jazeera's James Bays spoke with Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC regional director for Near and Middle East.

   <media:description>A large asteroid, 1998 OR2, will fly past Earth on Wednesday.
Astronomers say the asteroid, more than a mile (1.6km) wide, will not collide with our planet but will get close enough for us to study it.

Al Jazeera's Andy Gallacher reports from Florida, US.

   <media:description>Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has appointed an alleged drug trafficker as the country's new oil minister.
Tareck El Aissami was indicted in the United States last month, over allegations he violated sanctions and received payments for facilitating drug shipments. Charges he denies.
The Trump Administration has offered a reward of up to $10m for information leading to his arrest.
Meanwhile, the drop in oil prices, and additional sanctions from the White House, are making life harder for Venezuelans.

   <media:description>The economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic are being felt in many sectors of the global economy - aviation and oil in particular - and they are hitting the biggest players.
After already announcing it would cut aircraft production by a third and that the company was &quot;bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed&quot;, aerospace giant Airbus has posted a first-quarter loss of more than $500m.
The CEO warns this is the &quot;gravest crisis the industry has ever known&quot;.
Boeing has already announced plans to cut as many as 7,000 jobs.
The company's CEO predicts that global airline revenue could drop by more than $300bn this year, and it will take years to recover.
The United Kingdom's national carrier, British Airways, is set to cut up to 12,000 jobs, about one-third of its workforce.
The airline has suspended 96 percent of its flights for April and May.
Associate Editor and Chief Correspondent of Orient Aviation Tom Ballantyne discusses this issue with Al Jazeera.
