All the golf courses are closed in the desert communities. Declining to give his name, he said he's reading a novel by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Which seems very relevant during these times. Some of Nietzsche's famous quotes are, "To live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering," and "That which does not kill us makes us stronger." Also, "Without music, life would be a mistake."]]></media:description>

Clark has not been working since The Copenhagen House had to close due to the coronavirus pandemic. Solvang is a tiny town of 5,300 people nestled in the Santa Ynez Valley wine country, about a half-hour north of Santa Barbara. Tourists - mainly those who make the short drive from Los Angeles and Orange counties -- are the engine of an economy than generates nearly $200 million in economic activity a year. And without it hundreds in Solvang and the surrounding bedroom communities have lost their jobs while the city is losing $500,000 in tax revenue a month.

County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
