   <media:description>Have you ever just wanted a do-over in life—like hitting the reset button in a video game or selecting “undo” in a document? The #Bible speaks of #baptism as a powerful way to wipe the slate clean and have a totally new start. “The New Life” will unlock the secret to experiencing an all-new abundant life today.

This will be a beautiful study about starting over. It will show you the way to leave the past behind and find real meaning and purpose in your life.

CAMI OETMAN

Ten years ago, Cami Oetman had a real encounter with God that would change her life forever. She was a successful entrepreneur at the time, and the transition wasn’t easy. However, the truth Cami will share in this series was so compelling that she knew every human being in the world should experience the love of Jesus as she had.

Within three years, she had preached 350 Bible presentations. Today, as a vice president for Adventist World Radio, Cami travels the world documenting the miracles that take place when people give their hearts to Jesus.
It may seem difficult to imagine yourself understanding Bible prophecy. 

Cami couldn’t either. She had spent two decades in the modeling world — in front of and behind the camera. She had also used her master’s degree in social work to care for hospice patients. She then started a successful retail business. But no one can predict how they will react when they have a real experience with God!

THE NEW LIFE

Have you ever wanted to start over in life? The Bible tells us how we can get a new start.  In this study we will look at the new life– a fresh start that is available through Jesus.

Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan river to be baptized by John. But John hesitates, knowing he is unworthy. “Jesus replied, ‘It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires.’ So John agreed to baptize him” (Matthew 3:13-15). Jesus is immersed in the water. As Jesus comes out of the water His ministry begins.
 
Baptism is a crucial part of the Christian life. Not only was Jesus baptized as an example to us, but He also strongly admonished His people to be baptized. Baptism is a symbol of our willingness to accept the Gospel of Jesus. 

The Bible declares that there is only one true method of baptism. It clearly says in Ephesians 4:5, “One Lord, one faith, one baptism.” If so, then there is only one biblical method. We can’t go wrong by following Jesus’ example. 

When Christ was baptized, He went down into the water and came up out of the water. Jesus’ baptism was by full immersion! (Matthew 3: 16-17)

The whole person must be immersed, because the whole person has sinned. In fact, the Greek word “baptizo” or “baptize” means “to dip,” “to immerse.” Romans 6:3-4 says, “Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” How can sprinkling or pouring convey this message? 

Baptism is not the end of the Christian life– it is just the beginning! So, accept God’s mercy and begin again with a clean slate! Peter said in Acts 2:38: “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. . .” Accept the gift of the Holy Spirit’s guidance “. . . and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit”. Accept your place in the family of God.

Through baptism, a person is unified with Christ (Galatians 3:27). Yes, when you are baptized your sins are forgiven. Not only is your life cleansed, but you also receive the Holy Spirit and become part of an international community of faith!

   <media:description>Have you ever wondered if God has a true church on earth today? Does the Seventh-day Adventist Church fit the description of the remnant according to Bible prophecy?

This is a study that directly follows up on the previous topic. With a call to come out of Babylon, where do we go? In this topic, you will see—from the Bible—the identifying characteristics of God’s end-time remnant.

THE REMNANT
In the book of Revelation, God speaks of a dragon that makes war with the remnant people, because they have aligned themselves with God. We know that God is the winner of the battle with the dragon. So, how do we recognize this remnant movement who stand with God? 

Revelation tells us this remnant people will keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. 

What does it mean to keep the commandments of God? The Ten Commandments were given by God for all people and each commandment has a specific purpose and benefit for the people who obey its teachings. The very same people who keep these commandments will proclaim the three angels’ messages found in Revelation 14. 

The three angels’ messages are: 
The hour of God’s judgment has come. Worship Him who made heaven and earth (Revelation 14:7). God’s last-day church will call for worship of Him as Creator.
Babylon is fallen (Revelation 14:8). God’s church for today does not identify with Babylon. In Revelation 18:4 we see that this church must call people out of Babylon, saying “. . . Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins . . .”
Beware of the beast and his image and his mark (Revelation 14:9-11). God’s people today will tell others how to avoid the mark of the beast. Jesus says these are His three important last-day messages to take to the world. His people will carry out His instruction because they love Him and will warn the world out of their love for others.
So, now we know why it’s important to keep all of God’s commandments. What’s next? The remnant must also have “the testimony of Jesus Christ.” In Revelation 19:10, the Bible explains that “the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” This means that Revelation’s end-time people will also have the gift of prophecy, guided by the Holy Spirit. They will proclaim and teach Bible prophecies to the world. 

So what movement or group of people fit this description? Is there a church that does this today? Yes! Seventh-day Adventism is a rapidly growing Christian denomination, made up of over 18 million members participating in local conferences in over 215 countries. The Adventist movement honors God through teaching and application of a healthy lifestyle, supporting religious freedom and the separation of church and state, and spreading the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. It is a movement that accepts men and women of all races, all language groups, all cultures and all creeds. 
 
Do you want to be one of those that keeps the commandments of God and has the testimony of Jesus? This group is open to anyone that believes in the Word of God. Do you feel Him calling you to continue in your walk with Him into more and more light? Today is the day to &quot;follow the lamb wherever He goes” (Revelation 14:4).

   <media:description>Is there a master puppeteer behind all that’s going on around the world? Beyond conspiracy theories, there is a clear answer, and #Revelation identifies it through a strange woman, “The Harlot.”

This episode will be a study on the book of Revelation and the rise of Babylon. The #Bible tells people to “come out of Babylon.” How can you know if you’re in it? In this master class, Babylon will be identified from historical  books and the Bible.

THE HARLOT

The book of Revelation illustrates two different women to describe two different systems of religion – one that follows Jesus and one that has separated itself from Jesus.

In Revelation 12, there is a striking symbol of a woman dressed in white. In prophecy, a pure woman symbolizes the bride of Jesus or the true church (see Jeremiah 6:2 and Ephesians 5). God compares His church to a beautiful, pure woman who is faithful to her true lover, Jesus. She is undefiled with the corruption of false doctrine.

In Revelation 17, another woman arises. This woman rides upon a scarlet colored beast and the Bible calls her a harlot woman. She has left her true lover, Jesus. The harlot is the apostate system of religion. In this chapter we find that Babylon is a fallen church system that has committed fornication with the kings of the earth, thus symbolizing that instead of gaining its power from God, it obtains its power from the state as it is united with earthly authorities (see Revelation 17:1). 

Verse 3 of Revelation 17 identifies the harlot as blasphemous. She claims to have the power to forgive sins and stand in the place of God (see John 10:33, Matthew 9:2-3).

Rev. 17:4 clearly identifies the dress of the harlot as being “arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls . . .” 

Furthermore, this harlot, Babylon, has “in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication” (Revelation 17:4). She is a fallen system of religion with false doctrine that has confused all the world.

Verse 5 of Revelation 17 says Babylon is a mother, which means she must have children. Protestant denominations came out of Catholicism but have retained some of her false doctrines. These are the daughters of the Mother church.

Furthermore, she is identified as great, clearly showing the parallel between literal Babylon and spiritual Babylon. Like physical Babylon, spiritual Babylon represents a man-made religion established by men, based on human teachings, established on human ideas. There is a form of man-made religion, built by human religious leaders, that stands in opposition to the power of the gospel and the true church that Jesus built. 

IDENTIFYING MARKS OF SPIRITUAL BABYLON BASED ON LITERAL BABYLON

 ·  Babylon has an earthly head who speaks for God and in place of God (see 2 Thessalonians 2:4 and Isaiah 37:16).
·   Babylon was the center of image worship through all of the Old Testament. 
·   It was the center of false teachings about death teaching the immortality of the soul.
·   Babylon was also the center of sun worship. All sun worship came through varying pagan channels (see Ezekiel 8:16). 

God abhors these false systems of worship as they are doctrines of devils. However, God dearly loves His people, even though they may be currently deceived. He warns them to leave Babylon and all its counterfeit teachings!

   <media:description>The mark of the beast has been a hot topic for centuries. Will it be a microchip in the wrist, a universal ID card, or a hidden DNA marker in a vaccine? What is it really? Does the #Bible have insight into this provocative question?

“The Mark” will provide a clear answer to this with an intriguing study on Revelation 13 and the topic of the mark of the beast. What is the mark? Does anyone have it now? How can it be avoided?

She then started a successful retail business. But no one can predict how they will react when they have a real experience with God!THE MARKWhat is this mysterious Mark of the Beast?Who is the beast in the book of Revelation? Is it symbolic? And what does the number 666 really mean?

The good news is that Bible prophecy gives clear answers to these important questions. You’ll want to pay close attention in this episode’s look into The Mark.

In Revelation 13, the Apostle John writes that there are only two groups of people living on earth when Jesus Christ returns. There is the faithful group who worship God and have received His seal. And then there are those who worship the beast and receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads. Tragically, unless you know what the beast represents, you’re on track to receiving it.  

Thankfully, the Bible reveals what the Mark of the Beast means while revealing the identity of the beast.  

This beast of Revelation 13 is described as a worldwide religious and political power that would rule for 1,260 years. During this time, the beast would claim to be God and to have the power to forgive sins. Anyone who wouldn’t worship the beast would be persecuted, even to death.  

So, what religious and political power in history fits this identity? It is the Roman Catholic Church, a religious system that became a world power in 538 A.D. and declared itself as the head of all churches. During this time, the Papacy wiped out entire cities and populations in its effort to unite the world under its own religious system. However, in 1798, the Pope was taken captive and the Papal Roman empire crumbled. This is described in verse 3 as a deadly wound.

But the Bible says that this deadly wound would be healed. The beast appears to die but regains its power. Has this happened to the Papal Roman Catholic system?  

Today, the world looks to the Pope as its only hope for peace and unity.  Pope Francis has expressed his eagerness to unite Protestants back to the Catholic Church. To the honest observer, the beast has recovered from the deadly wound.  

Now that we know the unmistakable identity of the beast, what is his mark? The Catholic Record of London makes it clear by stating, “Sunday is our mark of authority . . . the church is above the Bible, and this transference of Sabbath Observance is proof of that fact.”  

The Mark of the Beast is the enforcement of the Papacy’s day of worship – Sunday. Satan gave this beast its power and uses it to work against God’s seal, which is His day – the seventh-day Sabbath.  

The issue is about worship. Do we choose God’s day or a day that man has honored? And could it be that this day of worship will be enforced once again by another world power? You may be surprised at the connection between the United States of America and this second beast in Revelation 13!</media:description>

   <media:description>This study will show you a timeline of what will happen after Jesus’ Second Coming. There are many different theories about hell and whether it is a real place. Some believe that people will burn for eternity. Is that true? This in-depth masterclass will provide definitive answers directly from the Bible.  

Other questions that will be addressed include: 
   - How can a God who loves torture people in burning sulfur forever?
   - Is there a second chance to be ready after Jesus takes people to heaven? 
   - Is there an eternally burning hot spot in the middle of the earth? 
   - Is hell the invention of fanatics?
   - Is hell just a state of mind?

ABOUT CAMI OETMAN

Ten years ago, Cami Oetman had a real encounter with God that would change her life forever. She was a successful entrepreneur at the time, and the transition wasn’t easy. However, the truth Cami will share in this series was so compelling that she knew every human being in the world should experience the love of Jesus as she had.

Within three years, she had preached 350 Bible presentations. Today, as a vice president for Adventist World Radio, Cami travels the world documenting the miracles that take place when people give their hearts to Jesus.
It may seem difficult to imagine yourself understanding Bible prophecy. 

Cami couldn’t either. She had spent two decades in the modeling world — in front of and behind the camera. She had also used her master’s degree in social work to care for hospice patients. She then started a successful retail business. But no one can predict how they will react when they have a real experience with God!


THE DESOLATION

After the second coming, Revelation 20 tells us that the saints will live and reign with Christ for a thousand years. During the thousand years– the millennium– the book of records will be opened. Saints will look at each person’s record and see the love and the justice of God in deciding their eternal destiny. We will even be able to see the record of the devil and his angels and help to decide their final punishment (1 Corinthians 6:3).

During this time, the devil will be confined to this planet (Revelation 20:2, 3). There will be no one else living on the earth. The devil will have no one to tempt, no war to instigate, no suffering to mastermind. Jailed by the circumstances of an empty planet, he will have time to reflect and to plan his final move.

At the end of the thousand years, God and His saints will return to the earth with the Holy City, the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:2). God has promised, “Behold, I make all things new” (Revelation 21:5). This glorious third coming is the beginning of creating a new earth. Before this can start, however, one last chapter in the saga of sin must be written.

Our earth, battered and torn, having laid waste for a thousand years, is the scene of this final chapter in the conflict between God and the devil. As the Holy City settles into the Mount of Olives, the power of God gives life to all those who chose not to follow Him (Zechariah 14:4). Revelation 20 describes their number “as the sands of the sea” (Revelation 20:8). The devil will be “loosed out of his prison” and work to convince all these people that it would be easy to overthrow the Holy City, and forever be rid of God, His rules, and His people (Revelation 20:7).

The devil and his angels, with those of all generations who chose against God’s government, prepare to take over the Holy City. As they march toward the city, fire comes down from God out of heaven and devours them (Revelation 20:9).

This is referred to as God’s “strange act” (Isaiah 28:21). It is against His nature to destroy any of His creation. Yet, those who have repeatedly denied His love and despised His invitation of mercy will finally experience eternal separation from God. The effect of their decision is forever. They are forever gone. The fire that devours them is only momentary, but the consequences of that fire are eternal. Those who have chosen to stand with the devil and his angels receive their reward of eternal death. “This is the second death,” Revelation 20:14 states. The fires of hell are the resolution to the last great conflict. They devour those who have forever decided against God.

It is up to us to choose on which side of the Holy City’s walls we will be found. It is our free choice to accept the love of God and stand with Him through eternity, or to choose against Him and be forever separated from God. Will you accept His gift of life?

She then started a successful retail business. But no one can predict how they will react when they have a real experience with God!

THE RESCUE
Does it ever seem like the world is spiraling out of control? Do you ever get the feeling that the end of the world is almost here? The good news is that in the midst of all the chaos, you can be confident that God has a personal rescue plan for you. This plan is none other than the second coming of Jesus Christ!

Why should we learn about what Jesus’ second coming will look like? About 2,000 years ago, the people of Jerusalem were left stunned and unprepared because Jesus’ first coming didn’t match their expectations. Rather than coming as a glorious conqueror, Jesus came meekly as a little baby, born to a poor family. Unlike Jesus’ first coming, you won’t have to wait to hear the news of His second coming—it will be impossible to miss! Still, even though Jesus’ Second Coming will be visible to every eye and audible to every ear, it makes all the difference to know how He will return. 

The Bible declares that at Jesus’ second coming, “. . . every eye will see Him . . .” (Revelation 1:7). His second coming will not be a mysterious event in a desert or a secret rapture. Although some say that Jesus’ second coming will be a secret, the Bible actually warned us in advance against the thought. In Luke 17:23, Jesus tells us that someday people will falsely say “. . .‘Look here!’ or ‘Look there!’ . . .”, but we should not follow them. This is because any person who claims to be fulfilling Jesus’ second coming, but meets privately with a group or an individual, is only an impersonation. As lightning is visible from all angles in the sky, so will His coming be visible from all directions (Luke 17:24). And don’t expect to see Jesus walking down the streets of New York or Tokyo, either. When Jesus returns, the righteous will “. . . meet Him in the air.” (1 Thessalonians 4:17)!  Finally, Jesus reminds us that we must always be prepared because no one knows the exact time of His coming (Matthew 24:36).

Jesus’ second coming will be the climax of earth’s history. He will rescue His followers from death, pain, and disease. Those who have died following Jesus will come forth from the grave alive with new, indestructible bodies. The bodies of His faithful followers will be instantly transformed, as quickly as the “. . . the twinkling of an eye . . .” (1 Corinthians 15:51-52). Today is the day to choose to follow Him, because “. . . now is the day of salvation.” (2 Corinthians 6:2). Your eternal destiny is hanging on the choices you make. 

In John 14:2, 3 Jesus promised, “. . . I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” Jesus has prepared a beautiful home for us in heaven, so beautiful that no one can fully grasp just how glorious it will be (1 Corinthians 2:9). The best way to find out is to be ready to meet Him when He comes!</media:description>

   <media:description>What happens 2 minutes after you die?  Is there life after #death? Is there reincarnation? What about karma? Answers can be found in the #Bible and they speak loudly from this episode: The Grave.

This episode will focus on the nature of man and what happens when you die. Great emphasis will be placed upon the reality that death is simply creation in reverse. The state of being during death is a simply unconscious rest awaiting the return of Jesus.

THE GRAVE

 
Have you experienced the loss of a family member or a loved one? Have you ever found yourself questioning, what happens when you die? We often hear stories of people who have had death experiences; they recall seeing bright lights, visions of Heaven, and even having out-of-body experiences. There is much controversy surrounding the topic of life after death. There are a number of different beliefs that are held by Christians and non-Christians alike. Some believe that, after you die, your soul goes to Heaven or Hell. Others believe in reincarnation or that death is simply the end. The most reliable source we have, the Bible, provides us with a clear answer on what really happens after death.
 
Many of the beliefs that people have about death today originate from ancient Greek philosophy, which teaches that the soul is immortal– it can live separately from the body and have a life of its own. This means that even after we have died, we are able to think, feel, and communicate with those on Earth and in Heaven. In contrast, the Bible views death as creation, only in reverse. Ecclesiastes 12:7: “Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.” God does not allow the soul to keep living after the body has died, instead, He preserves their identity in His mind alone. Their spirit is returned to God in the form of His power.
 
The Bible consistently refers to death as a sleep, even Jesus himself acknowledges this in the account of Lazarus found in John 11:11-25. God promises that there will be no more pain and suffering in Heaven. If we were able to witness the problems our loved ones are facing on Earth while we are looking down on them, wouldn’t this bring more pain rather than joy? God in His mercy would rather let us sleep than allow us to watch helplessly as our loved ones continue their lives on Earth.
 
Satan uses these false ideas about death to deceive us. Fallen angels appear to us as messengers, impersonating dead friends and relatives in order to communicate with those who are seeking guidance from them. Many people find comfort in knowing that their loved ones are enjoying Heaven; and, without realizing it, they listen to evil spirits and devils. The Bible predicts that evil angels will give warnings and foretell the future– appearing to be reliable– so their false teachings are accepted. These angels will influence the nations of the world and lead them to end-time events. We should seek our information from the Bible only. Satan can only deceive those who give in to his temptations. Those who rely on God’s word and endeavor to follow the truth will be rescued. Jesus is available to you always; all you have to do is ask Him.</media:description>

   <media:description>The Sabbath Day has always been Saturday according to the Bible. That's the seventh-day of the week. The Jews have always believed the Sabbath was Saturday. But Christians believe it is Sunday - who changed this and why does it matter so much?

The Bible predicts that a 'power' would change the 'times and the law'. This study will cover the gradual change of the Sabbath over the centuries. It will look at how it happened, why it happened, and who is behind this great deception. By the way, this 'power' is still operating today.

Have you ever been scammed? Did you know that one of the greatest scams in history has been bought by almost everyone on the planet? What is it? How can you and I avoid it? Don’t miss the answer in The Counterfeit.

She then started a successful retail business. But no one can predict how they will react when they have a real experience with God!

THE COUNTERFEIT
In Exodus 20:8-11, the Bible clearly states that “the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” So, why do so many rest and worship on a different day of the week? When is the Sabbath? Saturday or Sunday? Could it be that the Christian Church has allowed man’s tradition to overshadow God’s way? Finally, why does it matter which day is the true day of worship and which is the counterfeit sabbath?

The “first day,” or Sunday, is only mentioned eight times in the New Testament. Some of these verses describe how women returned to Jesus’ tomb on Sunday to finish preparing the body of Christ (Mark 16:1-2, Mark 16:9, Matthew 28:1, Luke 24:1, John 20:1). Jesus was crucified on Friday, called the “preparation day,” because they were to prepare for God’s holy Sabbath day, Saturday. Jesus then rested in the tomb on Sabbath, the “seventh day” of the week, and rose on Sunday, the “first day” of the week. 

If we look at other verses mentioning the “first day” in the New Testament, we see no hint of change.

Many Christians read in Luke 4:16 that Jesus, “as His custom was,” went to church on the Sabbath. Christ said in Matthew 24:20 that His disciples would be keeping the seventh-day Sabbath 40 years after the cross. So, Jesus didn’t change the Sabbath! The Bible promises in Hebrews 13:8, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” 

God did not change the Sabbath, Jesus would not change the Sabbath, and the disciples could not change the Sabbath! (Acts 5:29) 

We can look to Bible prophecy to see how God’s Sabbath could have been changed to a counterfeit. In Daniel 7:2-3, Daniel saw four great beasts come up from the sea. Daniel describes the beasts as a lion, a bear, a leopard, and a beast with ten horns. Verse 17 states that the beasts represent four kings, or kingdoms.

Most Bible scholars agree that the fourth beast represents the Roman Empire. Daniel 7:8 says “I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them . . . ” This little horn comes up among the first ten horns, after the fall of Rome.

Daniel 7:25 predicts, “He [the little horn] shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall persecute the saints of the Most High, and shall intend to change times and laws . . .”

The Bible tells us that Sunday’s sacredness comes from the tradition of men, changed from the law of God. It is Jesus Himself in Matthew 15:3-9 who says “in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.”

God says the Sabbath is a great sign. (Ezekiel 20:12; Exodus 31:16) It’s a sign of our loyalty to Christ. It is a sign that we can rest in the completed work of salvation through Christ. The Bible Sabbath matters so much to God that He wrote it in stone!

Are you willing to follow wherever Jesus leads? The road may be narrow, but the way of Jesus leads to the tree of life in the city of God.
