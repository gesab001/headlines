   <media:description>President Donald Trump hasn't even been reelected to a second term, and he is already thinking about a third. While serving three terms is Constitutionally banned, Chris Cillizza explains how this narrative falls into a bigger picture about Trump's legacy.

Former President Barack Obama used his speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention to draw a contrast between Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, saying that Trump is not a good custodian of democracy because he uses his position for personal gain instead of working for all Americans.

California Sen. Kamala Harris made history night as the first Black and South Asian woman to accept a major party's vice presidential nomination, promising to be a champion for the voiceless and forgotten Americans who are struggling in the midst of a pandemic and an economic crisis.
She introduced herself as the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants who would strive to restore the principles of inclusivity after four years of divisiveness under Trump, citing the example of her mother who she said taught her daughters to &quot;be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people&quot; and to believe that &quot;the fight for justice is a shared responsibility.&quot; Harris noted that was why she became a prosecutor who tried to reform the criminal justice system from within.
Harris said she and former Vice President Joe Biden share &quot;a vision of our nation as a beloved community -- where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love.&quot;
Though Americans may not &quot;agree on every detail,&quot; they are &quot;united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity and respect,&quot; she said.

   <media:description>The Senate Intelligence Committee released Tuesday the most comprehensive and meticulous examination to date explaining how Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign welcomed the foreign adversary's help, revealing new information about contacts between Russian officials and associates of President Donald Trump during and after the campaign.
In several key ways, the committee's counterintelligence investigation goes beyond the findings of former special counsel Robert Mueller released last year, as the Republican-led Senate panel was not limited by questions of criminality that drove the special counsel probe.
The report is all the more remarkable because it was led by then-Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. The report provides an exhaustive, bipartisan confirmation of the contacts between Russians and Trump associates in 2016 -- and it was the only congressional committee that managed to avoid the partisan infighting that plagued the other congressional investigations into Russian election meddling.
READ: Senate Intelligence panel&amp;#39;s fifth volume of Russia investigation report
The nearly 1,000-page report caps off a three-year investigation into 2016 election interference that included more than 200 interviews, including with top Trump family members and Trump campaign officials such as Donald Trump Jr., Kushner and Steve Bannon.
Unlike Mueller's report, which focused on questions of criminal conduct, the committee's report detailing the findings of its counterintelligence is hundreds of pages of facts the panel obtained, drawing conclusions in places where Mueller often stopped short of doing so.

   <media:description>President Donald Trump is calling on his followers to not buy Goodyear tires and threatening to remove them from his custom presidential limousine, despite previously railing against &quot;cancel culture,&quot; after an employee posted a viral photo of a company policy banning &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; and other political attire in the workplace.
&quot;Don't buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!),&quot; he tweeted Wednesday morning.
The tweet came in response to an employee who posted a photo, obtained by CNN affiliate WIBW, from a Topeka, Kansas, Goodyear plant that showed a slide during a training that &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; and LBGT pride apparel were &quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;Blue Lives Matter,&quot; &quot;All Lives Matter,&quot; &quot;MAGA Attire,&quot; and other political material were &quot;unacceptable.&quot;
Goodyear issued a statement following the President's tweet stating &quot;the visual in question was not created or distributed by Goodyear corporate,&quot; but that it asks its associates to &quot;refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party, as well as similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of racial justice and equity issues.&quot;
