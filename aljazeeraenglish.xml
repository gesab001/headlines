   <media:description>Syrian tycoon Rami Makhlouf said on Sunday that authorities set a deadline for him to resign from top mobile operator Syriatel or they would revoke its licence - but he promised not to step down.
Makhlouf said the government was piling pressure on him and threatening to arrest him unless he handed over company profits.
In a 16-minute Facebook video - the third he has issued publicising a rift with his cousin, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - Makhlouf said the collapse of Syriatel, a main revenue earner for the government, would deal a &quot;catastrophic&quot; blow to the economy.
Makhlouf was part of the president's inner circle and has played a big role in financing al-Assad's war effort, Western officials say, citing his business empire that includes telecoms, real estate, construction and oil trading.
Joseph Daher, a Swiss-Syrian academic at the European University Institute in Florence, talks to Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>Israel's Parliament has sworn in a new government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former rival Benny Gantz, ending the longest political crisis in the country's history.
The new government was set to confront serious crises in its first weeks, including the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus and a looming battle over Israel's possible annexation of large parts of the occupied West Bank.
Addressing the Parliament before the vote, Netanyahu said his incoming government should apply Israeli sovereignty over Jewish settlements, which are illegal under international law.

   <media:description>He's seen as an unparalleled political survivor, and once again, he's got what he wants.
Benjamin Netanyahu will lead a fifth government in Israel. But for the first time, he won't be governing alone.
Netanyahu will be rotating the prime minister's job with his former rival Benny Gantz - 18 months each.
That power-sharing deal was agreed last month, ending a year of political deadlock in which three inconclusive elections were held.
The unity government - now sworn in - is a rarity in Israel's politics.
Gantz says it's needed to tackle the coronavirus during 'not normal times'.
But what about Netanyahu and his own battles?  He's facing a corruption trial this month - the first sitting Prime Minister to do so.
He's also pressing ahead with a controversial plan to annex part of the occupied West Bank.

   <media:description>China is trying to walk a line between quelling scattered outbreaks of coronavirus and restoring a semblance of day-to-day normality. But concerns are mounting over the possible impact of the virus on hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims, many of whom are being held in so-called ‚Äútraining and education‚Äù camps that United Nations experts say are in flagrant disregard of international human rights law.

Uighur rights activists, as well as the relatives of those interned in the western province of Xinjiang, say cramped, unhygienic conditions in the camps allow the untrammelled spread of coronavirus. As COVID-19 cases in China increased earlier this year they urged the World Health Organization to seek a fact-finding mission to the region. Beijing responded by downplaying the risks of coronavirus in the Muslim-majority province, saying that the vast majority of those in the camps had since ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù and been released.  

As China tries to repair an economy dented by the coronavirus outbreak, Uighur rights advocates now say authorities are resuming job placements for Uighurs, moving them far from their families and homes. A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute alleges that authorities have transferred thousands of Uighurs to work in factories producing goods for some of the world's biggest brands, while keeping them under close watch. Authorities in Xinjiang, as well as companies accused of benefiting from forced labour, say the report is a smear ‚Äì highlighting the stark divisions over the treatment of Uighurs and the rights they hold in China. 

On Monday‚Äôs episode of The Stream, we‚Äôll be joined by Uighur voices to hear what's at stake for the wider community as China focuses on its fight against coronavirus. Join the conversation.

   <media:description>Political campaigns in Burundi have ended ahead of a general election on Wednesday. 
They have been marred by violence and hate speech, with both sides blaming one another. 
As Al Jazeera's Catherine Soi reports, health experts have also raised concerns that there are not enough safeguards to help contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.

   <media:description>Healthcare workers are on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus, and around the world they are being hailed as heroes. But, away from the headlines, many are tackling more personal battles.

A global study published in March in the medical journal JAMA found that, out of 1,257 healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in China, 50.4 percent reported symptoms of depression, 44.6 percent had symptoms of anxiety, 34 percent had experienced insomnia, and 71.5 percent reported some form of distress.

Healthcare workers are trained to work through crises but the coronavirus pandemic is like nothing they have ever faced. They find themselves navigating severe illness and death, all the while grappling with shortages of essential protective gear. Experts believe this will likely lead to burnout, depression, PTSD and other forms of psychological trauma.

In this episode of The Stream, we speak to mental health experts and medical professionals to hear about the pandemic's impact on their profession and to find out whether more can be done to protect these vital workers.

   <media:description>As Congress debates financial aid to states, New York, the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, is facing a $61bn budget deficit.
And there are warnings that it is hurting essential services trying to save lives during the pandemic.
Al Jazeera's Kristen Saloomey spoke to emergency medical technicians who warn a lack of funding in their department is already hurting the community it serves.

Many are afraid to seek government and medical help for fear of being deported.
And now, the pandemic is fuelling racism.

   <media:description>COVID-19 has killed more than 15,000 in Brazil and reported infections have surpassed those in Italy and Spain. Experts say that with a lack of testing, these numbers could be much higher.
But, President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly downplayed the risks of the disease and pushed to reopen the economy.
Many people, including healthcare workers, feel they are being left on their own to battle the pandemic.

   <media:description>As Hong Kong moved from 2019 to COVID-19, streets once jammed with protesters suddenly lay empty. The pandemic could not have come at a better time for the Beijing and Hong Kong authorities.

Following months of mass demonstrations - which saw hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers demand independence from China - critics say both governments have been using COVID as a cover to crack down on dissent and push through laws that would further curb the city's freedoms. 

&quot;Beijing certainly wants to ensure that the protests, the likes of which we saw last year, cannot be allowed to happen again. So they may be pushing through some controversial legislation, including national security laws and we've also seen pro-democracy figures rounded up. To be having all of this happening with a backdrop of COVID-19 and the social distancing measures in place I think, is no coincidence&quot;, explains Tom Grundy, co-founder of the news outlet, Hong Kong Free Press. 

One of the 15 prominent pro-democracy figures rounded up last month was a businessman called Jimmy Lai. Lai is a billionaire who owns the Apple Daily, Hong Kong's second-largest newspaper and the city's only openly pro-democracy mainstream outlet.

The Listening Post's Johanna Hoes spoke with Mark Simon, an executive at Next Digital, the media conglomerate that owns the Apple Daily, and he made the point that: &quot;Beijing was not gonna let a crisis go to waste. Lai and Apple Daily have been a thorn in the side of the Beijing-appointed government for as long as, basically, we've been around, since 1997. Arresting these people, that was a major move that they knew they could get away with just because of the coronavirus.&quot;

In a media landscape dominated by news outlets that are either under direct control of the Chinese Communist Party or in the hands of businesses with close ties to the mainland, Apple Daily's coverage of the protests was hugely popular among those on the streets.

But it was not the only outlet demonstrators turned to for news. For many nascent, digital media organisations, the democracy movement presented a news story - and even a financial opportunity - like no other.  

&quot;People really saw that the independent, newer outfits were the ones that were showing what was really happening on the front lines and they didn't feel that they were compromised in the same way that they perceived the mainstream media to be. So there was real support for these outlets&quot;, explains Yuen Chan, senior lecturer at City University in London.

One of the protesters' go-to new media outlets was Stand News. Its deputy assignment editor, Ronson Chan, explains his organisation's new-found popularity resulted in a huge financial boost. But as soon as the pandemic hit, those resources started to dry up.

&quot;For Stand News, the entire movement presented such a change - we had a significant increase in donations and our team grew from 10 to 30. But the pandemic has affected the economy. A lot of our readers who previously sponsored us are newly unemployed. Plus, we have seen fewer demonstrations so we have fewer live broadcasts and people have less interest in our platform.&quot; 

New protests this past week - albeit on a smaller scale - may be a sign that Hong Kongers are ready to return to the streets, despite the pandemic. The question is whether it is too late for outlets like Stand News.

   <media:description>The global coronavirus pandemic is having a significant impact on economies around the world.

Many years under heavy United States sanctions have forced domestic investment in Iran, which has been good for many local businesses, and domestic brands now dominate this big consumer market.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic which has forced millions to stay home and business to halt, some businesses are now doing everything they can to keep their doors open post-pandemic.

   <media:description>A massive voluntary testing programme is under way in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak was first reported late last year.
The first cluster of new infections since the lockdown was eased has been confirmed.
 
But as crowds formed at test centres, some people were concerned that going for a test could expose them to the virus.

   <media:description>The coronavirus pandemic has taken a lot out of the graduation celebrations many high school seniors were dreaming of.
Not only that, but the knock-on economic effects may well mean that many students who had planned to attend university are now cancelling their plans.

   <media:description>Whether people should visit England's beaches is not the only lockdown issue being debated right now in the UK.
The government is also aiming to get primary schools at least partially reopened in June, causing concern among many who do not think it is a good idea.
