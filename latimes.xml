The statue in San Francisco was defaced with red paint and graffiti, the day before a federal holiday celebrating the 15th century Italian navigator. Officials say the statue at the foot of Coit Tower in the city's North Beach neighborhood was vandalized sometime Saturday night or Sunday morning. Someone poured red paint over it and drew anarchy symbols and messages on the concrete base that read "Destroy all monuments of genocide" and "Kill all colonizers." City workers cleaned the statue Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019, as thousands celebrated Italian culture. (AP Photo/File)]]></media:description>
