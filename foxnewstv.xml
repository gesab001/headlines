Swing state polling is not looking for good President Trump. Despite the polls, the president and his campaign are confident the &quot;silent majority'' will give him a big win in November. Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) weighs in on the polls, his Senate race in Georgia, how the U.S. has handled the coronavirus and more.

18 weeks ago President Trump declared a national state of emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. Now, as states are starting to reopen, there is a spike in cases. Charles Payne host of Fox's Making Money with Charles Payne on Fox Business discusses how the economic recovery is going, the possibility of more financial help from Congress and the controversy of wearing face masks.

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by Robert Jeffress, Fox News Contributor and pastor of the Dallas First Baptist Church.
