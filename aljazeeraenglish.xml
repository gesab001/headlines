   <media:description>More than 90 people have been killed and tens of thousands left homeless after Cyclone Amphan slammed into coastal towns and cities in India and Bangladesh. Authorities are now working to help communities already stricken by the coronavirus, but are hampered by damaged power and communication lines.

   <media:description>Eight West African countries will soon be using a new currency.
And it may well be that you didn't even know they had an old one!
But for 75 years, the CFA as it would be said in French, has been used as money from Senegal to Niger and most places in between.
But now, the French government's officially approved the end of the CFA Franc.
It means France will cease to co-manage the West African currency. The Bank of France will no longer hold half of the currency's reserves, and a replacement currency, the ECO, will be introduced.
But it will keep its exchange rate fixed to the Euro.
France negotiated with its former colonies for three years before reaching the deal last year.
But is this genuine change, or just a rebrand?

   <media:description>On The Listening Post this week: How a conspiracy documentary hijacked US social media and fuelled misinformation on COVID-19. Plus: Peru and the art of digital homeschooling.

COVID-19 misinformation in US
So much about this pandemic remains unknown, which is why reporting on it is so challenging. A lack of scientific consensus, heavy-handed government policies, and lockdown-induced economic woes have resulted in a wave of fear, anxiety, and powerlessness - perfect conditions for misinformation and conspiracy theories to thrive.

The US is ground zero for a lot of these theories, not least because the president and outlets like Fox News have long trafficked in them. There is a market for conspiracy theories; one that can turn a discredited scientist and an obscure filmmaker into an internet phenomenon.

The Listening Post takes a look at 'Plandemic' - the viral sensation of COVID-19 conspiracy theories.

On our radar:
Richard Gizbert speaks to producer Nic Muirhead about a recent buyout in Italy meaning that Fiat automobiles now controls one of Italy's biggest newspapers - La Repubblica - and with it, a shift in editorial tone.

Listen, Watch, Learn: Peru's school system takes to airwaves
In many countries, it is still far too early to send children back to school. Take Peru, for instance; with more than 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, it has the second most of any Latin American country, behind Brazil.

One area where Peru seems to have fared better is education. Within three weeks of declaring a national lockdown, and with the collaboration of both public and private broadcasters, the Peruvian government brought to air Aprendo en Casa, or I Learn at Home - six hours of educational programming, every weekday.

The goal is to make the entirety of both the primary and secondary school curricula available to all students, including the millions without TV and internet access.

The Listening Post's Meenakshi Ravi takes a look at Aprendo en Casa - the TV and radio platform that is schooling Peruvian kids during lockdown.

   <media:description>The UK health secretary's deadline to roll out a mobile phone app to trace and contact possible coronavirus infections has been delayed. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to have a COVID-19 tracing system by June 1 in order to get businesses and schools going again. 
The app is being tested on the Isle of Wight where the local MP says the system will still be good enough.

   <media:description>The coronavirus pandemic has not spared a single nation or economy, but the way some governments have handled the crisis has raised eyebrows.

Brazil's right-wing populist leader Jair Bolsonaro has been dismissive about the health crisis and implored people to ignore state governors who had ordered lockdowns and social distancing measures.

The result: Brazil has the third-highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, behind the United States and Russia. A study by Imperial College suggest that 70,000 to one million Brazilians could die depending on measures taken to halt the progress of the pandemic.

Brazil's healthcare system has been decimated since 2017; its expenditure on its national health service has been slashed by $4.4bn - or slightly less than a third of its current budget. And in some regions, it is close to collapse from the sheer number of COVID-19 patients.

Despite a stimulus package, the economy is expected to contract 4.7 percent this year - the biggest fall since 1900. The situation is so bad that President Donald Trump is considering banning Brazilians from travelling to the US.

Bolsonaro has been criticised at home and abroad, so how much damage will this do to the economy and its 209 million people? We speak to Jimena Blanco, the Head of Americas Risk Insights at Verisk Maplecroft.

No longer recession-proof
Millions of jobs have been lost due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Despite the saying that the virus does not discriminate, it is having an unequal and devastating effect on low-income workers, immigrants and women.

But an altogether startling situation, despite the pandemic, is that medical personal are losing their jobs, as Al Jazeera's Shihab Ritansi reports.

We also speak to Sho Alexander Sugihara, the co-founder and chief executive of gig-economy finance app Portify, who explains what has gone wrong in the jobs market.

Germany's big bazooka to save the euro
Europe's biggest economy is back in recession, a little over a decade since the last financial crisis.

But trouble was brewing for Germany before the pandemic - and like everywhere else, worse is yet to come.

The government has pledged one trillion euros to support the economy. But it is Chancellor Angela Merkel's radical 500 billion euro plan to help fellow European nations that could face opposition and push the union towards another crisis.

Al Jazeera's Dominic Kane reports and we speak to Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

   <media:description>The United Nations says Yemen's health system has collapsed and is appealing for more funds to help its hospitals devastated by five years of war.
The country has reported about 200 cases of COVID-19 and 30 deaths, but aid agencies believe the number of infections is likely to be much higher.

   <media:description>The coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we live.

Nearly every country in the world has been affected. There have already been millions of infections, and hundreds of thousands of deaths.

And while scientists work on developing a vaccine, governments are focusing on reducing the number of infections through social distancing and other preventive measures.

But these restrictions have brought with them countless financial losses across the globe. The coronavirus recession is considered to be the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of 1929.

As COVID-19 measures halt international trade, shut down airports and leave businesses bankrupt, tens of millions of people have lost their jobs. And for many, being unemployed in the middle of a pandemic means not only losing their income but also losing access to healthcare.

So, how can governments protect their workers and rebuild their economies?

The director-general of the International Labour Organization (ILO), Guy Ryder, talks to Al Jazeera.
