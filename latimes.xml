Leon is shown with her two sons Omar Ramirez, 4, left, and Esgar Ramirez, 7, in their room. Leon shares a two bedroom one bath house with another family of four.

In Monterey County, agriculture workers make up 40% of positive COVID-19 cases and two-thirds of cases are concentrated among Latinos.

When the filters get clogged, the larvacean abandons them. The abandoned filters sink toward the seafloor, and become an important food source for other marine animals.
