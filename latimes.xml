DeAngelo Jr., 74, was sentenced to 11 life sentences in prison without the possibility of parole, one life sentence with the possibility of parole and an additional eight year sentence under a plea agreement that allowed him to avoid the death sentence. In June, DeAngelo Jr. admitted being the infamous Golden State Killer. The former police officer in California eluded capture for four decades. He admitted killing 13 people and raping nearly 50 people in the 1970s and 1980s. The sentencing was held at the University Union, a large enough space so that people could maintain physical distance, amid the coronavirus pandemic.]]></media:description>

The process to relicense the hydroelectric dam system on the Klamath River has restarted again as historic settlement agreements to remove four of the dams have thus far failed to make headway in Congress this year. The Klamath River basin, which straddles Oregon and California, has long been the site of intense political fights over the sharing of scarce water between farms and fish. The agreements to remove the dams, hammered out by farmers, tribes, environmentalists and states, are a compromise aimed to restore the river for imperiled salmon and steelhead, and give farmers greater certainty about irrigation water.
