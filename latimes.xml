    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[Huntington Beach, CA - October 05: An aerial view of environmental oil spill cleanup crews picking up oil chucks off the beach from a major oil spill at Huntington Dog Beach in Huntington Beach Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021. Environmental cleanup crews are spreading out across Huntington Beach and Newport Beach to cleanup the damage from a major oil spill off the Orange County coast that left crude spoiling beaches, killing fish and birds and threatening local wetlands. The oil slick is believed to have originated from a pipeline leak, pouring 126,000 gallons into the coastal waters and seeping into the Talbert Marsh as lifeguards deployed floating barriers known as booms to try to stop further incursion, said Jennifer Carey, Huntington Beach city spokesperson. At sunrise Sunday, oil was on the sand in some parts of Huntington Beach with slicks visible in the ocean as well. "We classify this as a major spill, and it is a high priority to us to mitigate any environmental concerns," Carey said. "It's all hands on deck." (Allen J.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[GAVIOTA COAST, CA - OCTOBER 12: Firefighters from California Conservation Corps prepare as flames from the Alisal Fire move toward La Paloma Ranch near Refugio Canyon Tuesday afternoon. Rancher Eric Hvolboll remembers the 2016 Sherpa Fire where he lost many avocado trees and broke a leg during g the blaze that burned through his La Paloma Ranch. The Alisal Fire is over 7,000 acres on Tuesday after it quickly grew Monday afternoon driven by sundowner winds as it burned through Tajiguas Canyon to the 101 freeway forcing its closure. Mandatory evacuations are in place as the gusty winds drive flames through rough terrain that hasn't burned in decades. The 1955 Refugio Fire that consumed 80,000 acres is the last time much of the area had burned. The historic Reagan Rancho del Cielo which sits near the top of Refugio Canyon could be threatened by the flames as the fire moves into Refugio Canyon. Refugio Road on Tuesday, Oct. 12, 2021 in Gaviota Coast, CA. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times).]]></media:description>

Cleanup crews began cleaning up the the damage from a major oil spill off the Orange County coast that left crude spoiling beaches, killing fish and birds and threatening local wetlands. The oil slick is believed to have originated from a pipeline leak, pouring 126,000 gallons into the coastal waters and seeping into the Talbert Marsh as lifeguards deployed floating barriers known as booms to try to stop further incursion, said Jennifer Carey, Huntington Beach city spokesperson. At sunrise Sunday, oil was on the sand in some parts of Huntington Beach with slicks visible in the ocean as well. "We classify this as a major spill, and it is a high priority to us to mitigate any environmental concerns," Carey said. "It's all hands on deck." (Allen J.

    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[Huntington Beach, CA - October 05: An environmental oil spill cleanup crew member picks up chucks of oil on the beach from a major oil spill at Huntington Dog Beach in Huntington Beach Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021. Environmental cleanup crews are spreading out across Huntington Beach and Newport Beach to cleanup the damage from a major oil spill off the Orange County coast that left crude spoiling beaches, killing fish and birds and threatening local wetlands. The oil slick is believed to have originated from a pipeline leak, pouring 126,000 gallons into the coastal waters and seeping into the Talbert Marsh as lifeguards deployed floating barriers known as booms to try to stop further incursion, said Jennifer Carey, Huntington Beach city spokesperson. At sunrise Sunday, oil was on the sand in some parts of Huntington Beach with slicks visible in the ocean as well. "We classify this as a major spill, and it is a high priority to us to mitigate any environmental concerns," Carey said. "It's all hands on deck." (Allen J.
