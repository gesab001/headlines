    <media:description type="plain"><![CDATA[CATALINA ISLAND, CA - AUGUST 07: Activist David Sanchez, of Huntington Park, who led the Brown Berets during the occupational protest in Catalina Island in 1972 as part of the Chicano Moratorium, revisit the point where he once protested in Avalon Friday, Aug. 7, 2020 in Catalina Island. The group of 26 planted a large Mexican flag on the point, referred to as Burrito Point by some locals, above the Chimes Tower and claimed the island in the name of Mexico. The Brown Berets are a pro-Chicano organization that emerged during the Chicano Movement in the late1960s to address the issues of educational reform, farm workers' rights, police brutality, anti-war activities and other problems confronting the Chicano community and was founded by Sanchez.
