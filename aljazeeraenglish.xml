   <media:description>Digital technologies have proven a popular tool for governments across Asia to monitor and contain the spread of the coronavirus. Medical authorities say tracking software has helped slow transmission, but critics say it has highlighted the power of governments to exploit people's personal data. Al Jazeera’s Sarah Clarke reports from Hong Kong.

   <media:description>The Malaysian government has detained more than 700 migrants and refugees. It says it is part of the effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. 

But it comes after weeks of increased social media attacks on foreigners. Some posts have accused them of spreading the virus. Others blame them for being a drain on the country’s resources. 

Al Jazeera's Florence Looi reports from Kuala Lumpur.

   <media:description>Governments all over the world are looking to smartphone technology to stay ahead of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Many are using or developing apps that track our movements, and let us know if we've been close to an infected person.
Tracking and tracing software will become even more important as countries start to ease lockdowns.
However, critics are worried about potential breaches to our privacy and security.
So how should we manage these concerns?

   <media:description>Prisoners in Argentina are being set free early over fears that the coronavirus will spread through correctional facilities.
Local media has reported that more than 2,000 prisoners have been put under house arrest. But Argentina lacks the resources to control this with ankle monitors.
Many have been protesting this step, which is used to release non-violent prisoners serving their sentences under house arrest.
But as Al Jazeera's Teresa Bo reports, victims say many of those let off has been involved in violent crimes.

   <media:description>While many businesses have had to shut down, zoos have had to keep some staff to take care of the animals. And with no income from visitors, this case hit them hard.
The government of the United Kingdom is working on a fund to support its 141 zoos and aquariums which have suffered a financial setback as a result of the coronavirus lockdown.
But as Al Jazeera's Charlie Angela reports, some say it will not be enough to cover their losses.

People are now being allowed to exercise outside.

   <media:description>On The Listening Post this week: Brazil's President Bolsonaro and COVID-19 misinformation. Plus, how well has the WHO performed as a key information source during the pandemic?

Brazil's Bolsonaro: Turning COVID-19 denial into media spectacle

A president at odds with his advisers and scientists over COVID-19, who has said the virus is no worse than the flu, and whose supporters accuse the media of hyping up the story. Not Donald Trump, but Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro.

Even as deaths in Brazil surpass China, President Bolsonaro continues to downplay the pandemic. After firing his health minister, he went on to attend a &quot;protest&quot; demanding military intervention to lift the lockdown. He also has the support of two of Brazil's biggest media players, Record TV and SBT. Whether Bolsonaro is in denial, or just playing politics, they are standing firmly by his side.

On our radar:

Richard Gizbert speaks to producer Meenakshi Ravi about a media storm in Pakistan, where a religious leader turned a televised coronavirus fundraiser into an attack on the broadcasters.

Who holds WHO accountable?

COVID-19 is the biggest news story most of us have ever seen. Of all the institutions responsible for getting information out, the World Health Organization (WHO) may be the most vital. 

The WHO is a specialised agency of the United Nations borne out of the recognition that no single country can manage a global outbreak, and that an international health body is needed to rise above the politics of national interests.

In this pandemic, however, the WHO has been accused of falling short of its mandate and was unable to act independently in accessing and assessing the outbreak. The WHO was only granted access to Wuhan in mid-February. And not only did it fail to verify the early information on COVID-19 coming out of China, but it amplified it by repeating Chinese misinformation.

On January 14, the WHO tweeted that there was &quot;no proof of human-to-human transmission&quot; of the coronavirus. But at the time, media in Hong Kong and other countries, were already comparing the virus to SARS and saying it was most likely transmitting from people to people.

The Listening Post's producer Nic Muirhead reports on the WHO, and how one of the most important news sources in the world may be compromised.

   <media:description>From a health crisis to a food crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is upending the world as we know it. The United Nations's World Food Programme (WFP) is warning of multiple famines &quot;of biblical proportions&quot; as tens of millions of people are plunged into starvation.

Long before the pandemic, the agency had been warning world leaders that 2020 would bring &quot;the worst humanitarian crisis since world war two&quot;. 

An estimated 135 million people face starvation and that could double to 265 million by the end of the year. It blames the perfect storm, the wars in Yemen and Syria, natural disasters and changing weather patterns. 

At particular risk are refugees and informal workers. For example, it is estimated that about 136 million people in India working in the non-agriculture sector are at immediate risk of losing their jobs.

With more than two billion people under lockdown, supply chains have been disrupted. But that disruption is not just in emerging and developing markets. 

The rapid collapse of economic activity has led to more than 30 million people applying for unemployment benefits in the United States and a sharp increase in demand at American food banks, according to food charities. And yet, farmers are destroying produce, dumping milk and culling livestock despite grocery stores struggling to stock shelves.

While rich nations have the financial muscle to see themselves through the crisis, it is the low income and developing nations that could see past economic gains disappear.

Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the Food and Agriculture Organization, explains what kind of effect the pandemic might have on the economies of developing nations. 

The spread of the virus among workers at US meat processing plants has raised concerns of food shortages. But, President Donald Trump passed an order to keep them open, which has been criticised by unions and some investors. 

Maria Lettini, the executive director of FAIRR, a $20 trillion investor group, explained how Trump's decision might sow the seeds for future pandemics. 

Loan or grants?

European Union nations hit hard by the coronavirus hope to convince others to provide them with grants rather than loans as they plan a route to recovery.

Italy and Spain would like to avoid taking loans, which would increase their debt burden. 

Italy's debt currently stands at 134.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and that number is expected to rise to 155.7 percent due to the crisis. 

European nations have spent more than 1.8 trillion euros ($1.99 trillion) on tackling the pandemic. But the economy is expected to contract by 7.5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. The EU has now agreed to a one trillion-euro ($1.11 trillion) recovery fund to help nations. 

Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at Macro Advisors, comments on the deal and Michael Reid, senior editor at the Economist, shares his thoughts with Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made his first public appearance in 20 days, North Korean state media reported early on Saturday, ending an absense that sparked speculation about his health.

The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Kim attended a ceremony marking the completion of a fertiliser factory in Suncheon, near the capital of Pyongyang, with other senior officials, including his sister, Kim Yo Jong.
