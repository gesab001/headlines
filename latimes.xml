Most detainees in segregation cells are sent there for fighting with other immigrants, according to guards. The facility, the largest and newest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), detention center in California, houses an average of 1,100 immigrants in custody pending a decision in their immigration cases or awaiting deportation. The average stay for a detainee is 29 days. The facility is managed by the private GEO Group. ICE detains an average of 33,000 undocumented immigrants in more than 400 facilities nationwide.

California's court leaders expressed alarm Wednesday over a new study that showed more than 100 courthouses in the state - including many in Los Angeles County - could collapse and cause "substantial" loss of life in a major earthquake. Courthouses near the top of the list of buildings in peril include the Stanley Mosk Courthouse and Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center, the Pasadena municipal courthouse, and courthouses in Beverly Hills and Burbank.
