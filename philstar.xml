<description>"It is unfortunate that MTRCB has not been able to evolve and rise above its martial law origins... and has not been a driver of self-regulation in the industry. It should focus its efforts on being an instrument to improve the quality of content being produced, instead of being a tool for censorship," Drilon said.</description>
