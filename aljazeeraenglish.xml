   <media:description>Dozens of people have been killed and thousands wounded in a powerful explosion that ripped through Lebanon's capital, Beirut.
The massive explosion on Tuesday at Beirut's port sent shockwaves across the city, causing widespread damage to buildings and shattering windows in different parts of the capital.
The exact cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. Mohammed Fahmi, Lebanon's interior minister, said the explosion was apparently caused by ammonium nitrate that was stored in a warehouse at the port.
Hamad Hassan, Lebanon's health minister, gave an initial death toll of 27, while some 2,500 were wounded. The death toll was likely to rise.

   <media:description>New legislation tabled in Washington DC could soon see all of the district’s convicted felons obtain the right to vote while incarcerated. 

Giving prisoners the right to vote remains a controversial issue. If passed, it will place the US capital alongside Maine and Vermont, the only two states in America where prisoners can cast an electoral vote. The debate around felons’ right to vote has an extensive history in the US and, as individual states determine their own legislation, policies are rarely uniform.

In this episode of The Stream we ask: should convicted felons have the right to vote, is it dependent on the crime committed and what are the social, political and ethical issues at play?

   <media:description>They're known for their role in ending the 26-year war against Tamil separatists. 
Now, they are seeking to extend their family's rule over the island nation.
President Gotabaya's party aims to win a two-thirds majority in Wednesday's parliamentary election.
He'll need it to amend the constitution and restore presidential powers curbed under changes to legislation in 2015.
The Prime Minister, Mahinda, wants to be re-elected. 
Many fear fractures within the opposition could help the Rajapaksas win outright. 
Such a victory would concern defenders of human rights, who accuse the pair of abusing power and cracking down on dissent.
So, how crucial is the election this time?

   <media:description>The family planning needs of more than 200 million women worldwide are unmet and the coronavirus pandemic looks set to make things worse.

As resources are diverted to fight the virus, experts warn an additional 49 million women may lose access to modern contraceptives and there could be an extra 15 million unintended pregnancies per year.

“Decisions made at every level of the response to the pandemic are resulting in women being further cut off from sexual and reproductive health services, threatening sharp rises in maternal and neonatal mortality,” aid group Médecins Sans Frontières said in July.

Travel bans and movement restrictions have had unintended consequences on family planning. Routine health services have been restricted in many places, impacting abortion care and sexual violence response. And the shock to the global supply chain of contraceptives has been severe. 

In this episode of The Stream we ask, why are more women and girls being allowed to die from secondary impacts of COVID-19 rather than from the virus itself?

   <media:description>A whistle-blower wants the Dutch government investigated, accusing it of ignoring his attempts to expose nuclear espionage.
Frits Veerman was punished for turning in his colleague who was selling secret intelligence to Pakistan in the early 1970s.
His colleague ended up building Pakistan's nuclear bomb and selling the technology to other countries.

   <media:description>The Malaysian police have raided Al Jazeera's Kuala Lumpur office and seized two computers, the news network said, condemning the incident as a &quot;troubling escalation&quot; in the government's crackdown on press freedoms.
The raid on Tuesday came after authorities in Malaysia announced they were investigating Al Jazeera for sedition, defamation and violation of the country's Communications and Multimedia Act.
The probe relates to a 101 East programme that aired on July 3 and examined the Malaysian government's treatment of undocumented migrant workers during the coronavirus pandemic.
Giles Trendle, the managing director of Al Jazeera English, said the network was &quot;gravely concerned&quot; by the raid and called on the Malaysian government to cease its criminal investigation against the network's journalists immediately.

   <media:description>Thailand has a strong gun culture that has been compared to that of the United States.  
But the mass shooting deaths of 29 people earlier this year prompted new questions about the need for reform.
According to surveys, Thailand tops the list for gun ownership in all of Asia with 15 out of every 100 people owning a firearm, 40 percent of which are unregistered.

Al Jazeera’s Scott Heidler reports from Korat, Thailand.

   <media:description>US President Donald Trump has publicly rebuked the head of the White House coronavirus taskforce.
He has accused Dr Deborah Birx of &quot;hurting&quot; his administration after she said the spread of COVID-19 throughout urban and rural America marks a &quot;new phase&quot; in the pandemic.

   <media:description>With several countries racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, the World Health Organization is downplaying expectations.
Its head says there may never be a &quot;silver bullet&quot; that eradicates the virus - and that testing and containment efforts are still our best defence.
The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has just announced tests that can provide a result within 90 minutes.
 
Al Jazeera’s Sonia Gallego reports from London.
