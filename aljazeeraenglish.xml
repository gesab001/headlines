   <media:description>Not everyone is in the same boat! 
The 26 richest people in the world, hold as much wealth as half its population
Life chances depend on gender, race and whether or not a person has a disability. 
These global inequalities are being made worse by the pandemic. And the world is reaching a breaking point. 
A bleak reality laid bare by the UN secretary general. Antonio Guterres has delivered one of his most hard-hitting messages. 
He says the disparities start with the biggest institutions, and they should be eradicated under a new model of global governance, that guarantees a fair share of wealth, opportunity and power.
But how's that even possible?
And does the pandemic offer a chance for change?

Presenter: Sami Zeidan
Guests

Max Lawson, Head of Inequality Policy at Oxfam.

Alexander Deane, former Chief of Staff to David Cameron when he was the Shadow Secretary of State for Education.

   <media:description>Across the United States, cases of COVID-19 continue to proliferate and the start of the new school year is just around the corner. 

Students, teachers and parents have started planning the return but what school should now look like has become a contentious - and politicised - issue. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued a statement in favour of bringing children back to the classroom this Autumn if it can be done safely. 

&quot;Science and community circumstances must guide decision-making and funding is critical,&quot; it said.

The Centers for Disease Control has also published a document outlining health protocols that should be followed.

But many teachers say this is not enough. Their representative organisations have said schools may remain closed if funding is not made available to pay for appropriate safety precautions.

With just four months until a presidential election, US President Donald Trump is pushing hard for life to return to normal. But most education policy in the US is determined at the state and local level, and not by the federal government.

Global data suggests that children are far less likely to become seriously ill from the coronavirus than adults. But there are unanswered questions, including how often children become infected and what role they play in transmitting the virus. Given that, several experts advise caution. 

In this episode of The Stream, we take a look at both sides of the debate and ask a panel of experts whether compromises can be made to ensure American children have access to the best education possible.

   <media:description>For millions of people, movies and television series have been an escape from the stress and boredom of lockdown. 

But the coronavirus pandemic managed to stop the entertainment industry in its tracks, with some films forced to delay their releases. 

Thousands of actors and crew have found themselves out of work while movie directors are trying to find alternative ways to continue production. 

Al Jazeera's Rob Reynolds explains from Los Angeles, US.

   <media:description>The United Kingdom is set to launch a campaign encouraging people to lose weight to help tackle the worst effects of COVID-19.
Science has shown that chronic obesity can increase the severity of the virus in some patients.
But some health experts say the plan fails to provide the tools people need to improve their health.

So is it safe to fly right now? And has the pandemic changed the way we fly forever?
Start Here buckles in for the future of flight.

   <media:description>Some of the biggest names in the world of literature - Dickens, Hemingway, Garcia Marquez - got their start in journalism. Their reporting tends to be forgotten; their prose is what lives on.

Ghassan Kanafani is a name you can add to that list. Kanafani was a Palestinian writer who, through books like Men in the Sun, humanised the Palestinian condition of dispossession and displacement. He was, however, first and foremost a journalist.

He was also a product of 1960s Beirut - a period when the city was a magnet for young reporters, revolutionaries, migrants and misfits, as well as host to the Palestinian leadership in exile. It was in Beirut that Kanafani produced Al Hadaf, a forward-thinking Palestinian magazine, that has been somewhat lost in the mists of time.

The Listening Post's Tariq Nafi reports from Beirut, Lebanon, on the legacy of Ghassan Kanafani and the era of Palestinian revolutionary media.

   <media:description>In Israel, there have been protests in Tel Aviv and West Jerusalem against the handling of the coronavirus pandemic by the government.
Police used water cannon on the protesters in West Jerusalem to try to disperse the crowds.
Israel reimposed restrictions after a surge in cases last week, which angered demonstrators.
There have been protests for weeks over the economic situation and lockdown measures.
There were also chants demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resign.

Earlier, we spoke with Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, who joined us from West Jerusalem, to discuss the latest updates.

Adama Traore was arrested on his birthday after running away from officers who approached him for an identity check. But hours later, he was declared dead. 
Nobody has been convicted over his death.

   <media:description>The Mexican government is analysing a video showing dozens of gunmen and armoured vehicles, apparently belonging to the powerful Jalisco drug cartel.
It seems to be a show of force before a visit by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to three states where the group has a stronghold.

Al Jazeera's John Holman reports from Mexico City.

   <media:description>Syria is holding parliamentary elections on Sunday - the third such ballot since the uprising began in 2011.
The government has regained more territory since the last vote four years ago, but at least 30 percent of the country remains under opposition control.
Syria's government is also ignoring a UN-led peace process that would pave the way for internationally-monitored elections.

Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr reports from Beirut, Lebanon.

   <media:description>Sudan's transitional government has announced the amendment of several criminal laws, part of its break with the era of deposed president Omar al-Bashir. But while many Sudanese welcome the changes, they remain uneasy at the pace of change overseen by military and civilian leaders - especially when there is no functioning legislature to represent the people. 

Is Sudan's transitional government on track to deliver a promised democratic future for all?

   <media:description>In recent weeks, the United States has announced a number of economic policies aimed at China.

These include imposing sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights violations of Uighur Muslims, ending preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong, and passing the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which allows for further sanctions.

It comes amid rising tensions between China, the US and other global powers, as continuing trade disputes and recent territorial moves by Beijing erode relations.

We discuss whether the US government will go further - to restrict Hong Kong's ability to use dollars, which would undermine the self-governing territory's dollar peg and damage its financial operations.

Also on Counting the Cost: We examine Turkey's military expenditure and the cost of wars in Libya, Syria and Iraq. Plus, how is Russia's economy faring amid low oil prices and the pandemic? We look at Vladimir Putin's plans for the future.
