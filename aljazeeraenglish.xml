   <media:description>The leader of the Orthodox Church in Russia has consecrated a new cathedral dedicated to the armed forces.
But the monument is causing unease among many Russians, who say it shows more devotion to military leaders and not to religion.

   <media:description>The killing of George Floyd in U.S. police custody has triggered anti-racism protests around the world.
Rallies in Britain highlighted discrimination against minorities, as well as Britain's colonial past.
Far right protesters held counter rallies after the statues of colonial figures and slave traders were removed.
People also rallied against racism and police violence in France.
And protesters in Belgium defaced statues of King Leopold II, who ruled Congo in the 19th century when tens of millions of Africans were enslaved and killed.
Can Europe and the U.S. learn from each other about how to deal with the legacy of racism?

   <media:description>A new domicile law for Indian-administered Kashmir is fuelling anxiety among people already enduring security restrictions imposed by India’s central government that have been criticised by UN experts.

For decades, Kashmiris had rights on education, jobs and land enshrined within legal codes that accompanied semi-autonomy. But that all changed in August 2019, when the BJP-led central government revoked the region’s special status, without any direct input from Kashmiris. The central government went further in March, introducing laws that dramatically expand who can live permanently in the newly-designated Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

The new rules allow Indian citizens who have lived in Jammu and Kashmir for 15 years to claim a 'domicile certificate' for residency benefits, as well as those who have studied there for seven years. Children of central government officials who worked in Jammu and Kashmir for at least ten years can also apply, even if they have never set foot in the territory. Kashmiris were not given an opportunity to vote for or against the new law, and local parties say the central government did not consult them over amendments to the measures.

Officials within the BJP-led central government say the domicile law will usher in &quot;equality and dignity for all&quot;. But people across Kashmir are worried that the new laws will clear the way for people across India to move into the region based on scant documentary proof, taking jobs and opportunities from indigenous Kashmiris. Legal scholars say the new domicile laws will encourage “demographic flooding” of Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir and render stateless indigenous Kashmiris who are unable to prove their residency and obtain a domicile certificate.

We'll look at how Kashmiris are reacting to the new domicile laws and their concerns for the future. Join the conversation.

   <media:description>At least 20 soldiers and more than 40 civilians have been killed, and hundreds injured in twin attacks in northeast Nigeria's Borno state, residents and a civilian task force fighter said.
The attacks on Saturday, in the Monguno and Nganzai areas, came just days after armed fighters killed at least 81 people in a raid on a village in a third area, Gubio.

   <media:description>New protests have broken out in the US city of Atlanta following the police killing of another Black man on Friday. Demonstrators are angry after Rayshard Brooks was shot by officers after a struggle at a fast-food restaurant, and died later in hospital. Police said Brooks, who had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through, had failed a sobriety test and resisted arrest. The officers tried using a police taser on him, but a fight broke out. Video footage, which was posted on social media, shows Brooks on the ground outside his car, struggling with two police officers. The shooting later occurs out of frame.

Al Jazeera's Andy Gallacher reports from Miami, Florida.

   <media:description>Reform, defund, or dismantle? The death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police last month is raising big questions about how to improve law enforcement in the United States.

Public support for police reform has been growing in recent years, but meaningful change has proved elusive - and what that change would look like remains up for debate.

Amid nationwide protests, many top officials agree that at the very least, police accountability and oversight must increase. But some community leaders are pushing for more drastic changes, including reducing police budgets and redefining the role of law enforcement.

In Floyd's Minneapolis for example, the City Council has voted to disband the police department in favor of a more community-oriented agency “that actually keeps us safe,” President Lisa Bender said this week. However, critics argue that defunding law enforcement could lead to more crime, not less.

In this episode we ask, what should be done about America’s policing problem? Join the conversation.

   <media:description>After 26 years on the run, Felicien Kabuga - the man accused of being one of the key figures behind Rwanda's genocide - was arrested in Paris on May 16, 2020. A French court has ruled that he will be sent to Arusha, Tanzania to be tried in the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. He has been indicted on two counts of crimes against humanity and seven counts of genocide, including &quot;the direct and public incitement to commit genocide&quot;. That count relates to his part in setting up and funding Radio Mille Collines, or RTLM, Rwanda’s infamous radio station that played a key role in the genocide.

RTLM started broadcasting in August 1993. As president of the station, Kabuga oversaw RTLM’s editorial agenda - an agenda that, from the outset, called for Rwanda’s majority Hutu population to “exterminate” the minority Tutsis.

“It was a radio station run by genocide ideologues and all day long it was used to insult and demonise Tutsis, to say that they were a cancer,” recalls Jean-Pierre Sagahutu, a Tutsi who told The Listening Post’s Nicholas Muirhead that he survived the genocide by hiding in a septic tank for two months and 15 days.

From the outset, one of RTLM’s key objectives was to radicalise the Hutu youth - they would come to be relied upon to carry out most of the killings. As a new station on the Rwandan airwaves, RTLM needed to recruit listeners and the strategy Kabuga and his co-founders put in place was to play popular music to attract the young. The songs would then be interspersed with hate messages about the Tutsis.

Tom Ndahiro is a Rwandan academic and expert on the genocide. He says that the music - which often contained lyrics of Hutu extremism - served a dual purpose because when the killings began, RTLM would continue playing the songs as a way of alleviating the perpetrators’ guilt.

“It's evil genius, how do you entertain killers as a way of taking away the guilt? This is what RTLM did,” says Ndahiro.

RTLM also helped to coordinate the killings. Catherine Bond was one of the few international journalists in Rwanda during the early stages of the genocide. After joining a convoy of French troops travelling into the centre of Kigali, she witnessed groups of Rwandans lining the streets. They had been called out of their houses by RTLM to greet the French troops - but it was all a ploy.

“People had come out of their houses who were Tutsis in hiding,” remembers Bond, “and the Hutu militiamen had been able to identify them and had moved in and killed them.”

The genocide lasted 100 days, claiming the lives of nearly one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Kabuga, along with many of the perpetrators, was able to flee Rwanda. He managed to disappear from public life, however his legacy - and the legacy of RTLM - would spread across the region. Multiple governments have since raised the spectre of Rwanda - and the hate messages broadcast on Radio Mille Collines - as justification to clamp down on media freedom in their own countries. 

History has already judged Felicien Kabuga. Now the courts will do the same.

   <media:description>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned a far-right demonstration in London as &quot;racist thuggery&quot;.
Violence broke out between the far-right groups and anti-racism protesters who were holding a counter-rally.
Some of the far-right crowd also attacked the police officers trying to keep the two sides apart.
