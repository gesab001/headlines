   <media:description>Students in a southern Pennsylvania school district are battling the latest example of panic spreading over how history and race are taught in schools across the US.
&quot;I don't think a moral compass will let you ban books about equality and loving each other,&quot; Central York High School senior Christina Ellis told CNN.
Ellis is among the students protesting a book ban in York, Pennsylvania, and questions whether the officials who decided to remove certain reading materials from the curriculum even read the resources they deem controversial. She was joined by other teens protesting in front of Central York High School this week.
On Monday, students, parents and other community members debated during a virtual school board meeting about the list of anti-racism books and resources that were banned from the curriculum by the Central York school board last year.
Last October, the all-White school board unanimously banned a list of educational resources that included a children's book about Rosa Parks, Malala Yousafzai's autobiography and CNN's Sesame Street town hall on racism. CNN's Evan McMorris-Santoro reports.

Mark Milley's concern about former President Donald Trump reported in &quot;Peril,&quot; a forthcoming book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa are remarkable, but not surprising because past Trump officials have raised similar concerns.

   <media:description>Alex Murdaugh, the South Carolina lawyer whose wife and son were shot and killed in June, plans to voluntarily surrender to police  on charges related to a subsequent insurance fraud scheme, his lawyer told CNN.
According to court documents, Murdaugh arranged for a former client to kill him so that his surviving son could collect a life insurance payout of about $10 million.
One of Murdaugh's lawyers, Jim Griffin, told CNN that they have been informed an arrest warrant has been issued for Murdaugh on charges of conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Murdaugh plans to voluntarily surrender at the Hampton County jail by 2 p.m., according to Griffin.
Murdaugh was shot in the head on a roadway September 4 but survived. A family spokesperson had previously blamed the shooting on an unidentified man in a blue truck. However, Murdaugh admitted to authorities Monday that he had conspired with a man -- identified by police as Curtis Edward Smith -- to kill him as part of the scheme, according to an affidavit to support charges against Smith.
Murdaugh decided to end his own life but believed his life insurance policy had a suicide exclusion, his other attorney Dick Harpootlian said, and that the scheme &quot;was an attempt on his part to do something to protect&quot; his eldest and only living child.
Additionally, state investigators have announced the opening of two other investigations regarding the 2015 unsolved death of a teen as well as the 2018 death of the Murdaugh family's housekeeper.
The killings of his wife and son on June 7 have not been solved, and Murdaugh has denied responsibility.

   <media:description>CNN's Jamie Gangel reports that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley consulted with former Defense Secretary Mark Esper and former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller before he called his Chinese counterpart about former President Donald Trump, and that 15 people were part of the call including a Trump State Department representative.
The Joint Chiefs chairman has since come under attack over new reporting in &quot;Peril,&quot; a forthcoming book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, which details Milley's phone conversations to reassure a nervous Chinese general and efforts Milley took to limit then-President Donald Trump from potentially ordering a dangerous military strike.
Former NATO supreme allied commander Gen. Wesley Clark tells Anderson Cooper that Milley should be praised for what he did.

   <media:description>Trinidad and Tobago Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh criticized as &quot;false&quot; the claim by American rapper Nicki Minaj that a person on the Caribbean island suffered swollen testicles after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine.
Trinidad-born Minaj sparked an international furor when she alleged on Twitter that her cousin in Trinidad refuses to get a vaccine because his friend became impotent after being vaccinated.
&quot;His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding,&quot; Minaj, who has 22.6 million Twitter followers.
The comments triggered an international backlash, with senior US and British coronavirus officials condemning the claims.
Deyalsingh also denounced the statement by the Grammy-nominated artist as a waste of time.

   <media:description>Olympic gymnast Simone Biles ripped the FBI and the Justice Department in Senate testimony Wednesday for how FBI agents mishandled abuse allegations brought against Larry Nassar and then made false statements in the fallout from the botched investigation.
Biles -- a winner of seven Olympic medals, as well as several world and national championships -- revealed this year that she was motivated to compete in the Tokyo Summer Olympics in part because it would force the sport to confront its shortcomings in protecting its athletes.
In her testimony Wednesday, she said that the year-long delay of the Tokyo games meant &quot;living daily among the reminders of this story for another 365 days.&quot;
&quot;I am a strong individual and I will persevere, but I never should have been left alone to suffer the abuse of Larry Nassar,&quot; Biles said. &quot;And the only reason I did, was because of the failures that lie at the heart of the abuse that you are now asked to investigate.&quot;
