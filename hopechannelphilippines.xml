   <media:description>Would applying the Ten Commandments given to Moses change society? What has happened to the values of yesteryear? How has our society become so self-centered, disrespectful, and entitled? Is there a better way?  Is it possible that we‚Äôve forgotten our most foundational values? 

There is a different path, The Way reveals that journey. This masterclass will explore the Ten Commandments and what they mean, how they apply and do they have any significance in the life of a Christian.

Ten years ago, Cami Oetman had a real encounter with God that would change her life forever. She was a successful entrepreneur at the time, and the transition wasn‚Äôt easy. However, the truth Cami will share in this series was so compelling that she knew every human being in the world should experience the love of Jesus as she had.

Within three years, she had preached 350 Bible presentations. Today, as a vice president for Adventist World Radio, Cami travels the world documenting the miracles that take place when people give their hearts to Jesus.

It may seem difficult to imagine yourself understanding Bible prophecy. Cami couldn‚Äôt either. She had spent two decades in the modeling world ‚Äî in front of and behind the camera. She had also used her master‚Äôs degree in social work to care for hospice patients. She then started a successful retail business. But no one can predict how they will react when they have a real experience with God!

THE WAY

While in today‚Äôs world, everyone seems to have a different definition of what is right and wrong, God has outlined a clear standard for morality. In Exodus chapter 20 God has given us the Ten Commandments to show us the way to love and freedom. The first four commandments show us how to have a relationship with God, while the last six commandments deal with our relationship with each other.

In the first four commandments, we find that God desires us to acknowledge Him as our Creator and to give Him first place in our lives (Commandment #1). He desires us to worship Him ‚Äúin spirit and in truth‚Äù (John 4:24) rather than through man-made idols (Commandment #2). God asks us to respect His name as a sign of our loyalty to Him (Commandment #3). Furthermore, God asks us to keep His Sabbath day holy and spend a 24-hour period in worship and thanksgiving with Him (Commandment #4).

The last six commandments admonish us to honor our parents (Commandment #5); leave off acts of harm such as hate, anger, revenge and murder (Commandment #6); stay true to our marriage vows (Commandment #7); not take anything that is not rightfully ours (Commandment #8); not involve ourselves in lying or gossiping (Commandment #9); and calls us to be content with what we have trusting that God will provide everything that we need (Commandment #10).

God‚Äôs law is like a wall of protection, prohibiting us from falling into one of the many landmines of sin. It is God‚Äôs desire for man and woman to be happy and live in peace. Obeying God‚Äôs rules will save us from learning things the hard way, but by themselves they won‚Äôt give us a personal experience with God. In fact, a list of rules without having an actual experience with God can be a miserable experience. 
The reason we obey is not because we are trying to earn God‚Äôs favor. It‚Äôs the response of our love for Him. Will you choose to follow His way today?

   <media:description>This will be a masterclass on Revelation 14. We have seen polarizing politics, increased hate crimes, hunger for power, and the oppression of the poor. Is there a lasting solution to all of these problems? The Warning provides a framework for understanding that there is a day of reckoning and how you can be safe.

The book of Revelation presents the Gospel message being the good news of Jesus' saving grace. That good news also comes in the form of a somber warning that there is an end coming where the world will be judged. God calls for each of us to be ready.

THE WARNING

Do you seek relief from the things that you‚Äôve done wrong?  Are you searching for peace in place of anxiety and fear?  You‚Äôre not alone.  In this look at what God says about the end of time, you‚Äôll leave your fears behind and find new hope in God‚Äôs love for you!

God has often sent warnings before disasters strike.  Inspired by God, Noah warned of a worldwide flood that destroyed the earth just as Joseph forewarned Pharaoh of a devastating famine.  And God has sent another warning to you and me to prepare for the end of time.  

In Revelation 14:6-9, we find this final message of warning.  The good news is that it is wrapped in God‚Äôs love for us.  It is known as the ‚Äúeverlasting gospel.‚Äù  A message reminding us that God willingly let His only son be put to death to pay for our sins.  

How encouraging!  Though we must face God‚Äôs judgement, He has provided a way to ensure our forgiveness through Jesus!  And this forgiveness also opens the door for eternal life with Him in heaven!

The first angel gives the warning to ‚Äúfear God‚Äù and to ‚Äúgive glory to Him.‚Äù  These instructions show our need to obey God‚Äôs law and to follow His teachings for how to live our lives.  (See Ecclesiastes 12:13 and 1 Corinthians 10:31)  

Next, the angel turns to the issue of worship.  You see, we live in an age where millions reject God as our Creator.  In this message of warning, God is calling the world to worship him as our Creator God.  

Why is this message so important?  The angel says that ‚Äúthe hour of His judgement is come.‚Äù  This indicates that God is doing the judging now.  A time of investigation is taking place before Jesus comes so that He will know who gets the reward of eternal life.  (See Revelation 22:12)

Could it be that we are living in this time of judgement?  Is our future being decided by the choices we make today?  This can be scary to think about, right?  

The good news is that God has warned us ahead of time.  We don‚Äôt need to be afraid.  He wants us to be ready and has opened the way for us to have everlasting life!

The second and third angels focus on truth and error.  Many people are being misled by following the false teachings of men rather than listening to God‚Äôs Word.  The warnings of these two angels are some of the most serious in all of the Bible.  

Don‚Äôt worry.  In upcoming videos, we will look into the meaning of Babylon and the Mark of the Beast.  Just remember that God‚Äôs Word is our source of safety and of truth!  (See John 17:17)

The key takeaway from this final warning is that you can be prepared to stand before God in this judgement.  Through the messages of the three angels, God has provided a way for the world to be ready when He returns to earth.  

God is preparing a group of people who will worship Him as Creator.  They will obey Him because they love Him.  And this group of individuals will stand up for Jesus no matter what happens.  

Have you come to a place where you want to give your life to God?  Do you want forgiveness, peace, and the assurance of God‚Äôs love?  Take this moment and give Him your heart!
