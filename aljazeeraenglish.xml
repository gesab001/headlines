   <media:description>Luiz Inacio da Silva, also known as Lula, was president of Brazil from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2010.

The former labour union leader lifted millions of people out of poverty in one of the world's most unequal countries.

Lula was jailed in 2018 after the &quot;car wash&quot; investigation saw dozens of politicians imprisoned and accused of corruption. He was released after 580 days on grounds that he had been denied a due process.

The 74-year-old former president talks to Al Jazeera about current President Jair Bolsonaro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the United States's involvement in Latin American affairs.

   <media:description>Donald Trump often calls himself the 'law and order' president.
He's accused some city mayors of failing to rein in weeks of protests against police brutality.
Trump sent in federal agents to Portland earlier this month.
He has since announced a 'surge' of federal officers to other cities such as Chicago to combat violent crime.
Several mayors have denounced the deployment as a re-election stunt.
Will this set a dangerous precedent for American democracy?

   <media:description>With more than 146,000 deaths and counting, the United States has been the hardest hit country by COVID-19.

In this first episode of a special Head to Head series, we challenge prominent members of the Republican and Democratic parties on their handling of the crisis.

In part one, Mehdi Hasan challenges Jack Kingston, a surrogate for the Donald Trump campaign, and a former Republican congressman.

Our second guest, Jess O'Connell, is the former CEO of the Democratic National Committee who has worked on Hillary Clinton and Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaigns.

So, who is to blame for the US COVID-19 catastrophe?

*Editor's Note: These interviews were recorded on July 9 and 13, and since then, some of the data quoted has changed, including the number of cases and the death toll, which have sadly grown exponentially.</media:description>

   <media:description>West African leaders have arrived in Bamako on a high-stakes mission aimed at defusing Mali's weeks-long political crisis that has raised concerns of further instability in a country grappling with multiple crises, including an escalating conflict.
The visit on Thursday by the presidents of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal comes days after a mediation mission by the West African regional bloc ECOWAS failed to break the deadlock.
The foreign leaders are expected to meet Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and key figures of the opposition coalition behind the protests, known as the June 5 Movement.

   <media:description>French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has arrived in Lebanon on a visit aimed at pressing Beirut to implement long-overdue reforms and dissociate from regional conflicts, both seen as key to unlocking international aid.
Le Drian's two-day visit comes as Lebanon spirals into its worst-ever economic crisis that is leading to mass poverty and rising hunger. On Thursday, he is set to meet Lebanese leaders, including President Michel Aoun, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Hassan Diab.
In May, Diab's government began talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $10bn programme. It is seeking an additional $11bn in aid from the international community over the next five years to stave off the effects of the crisis.

   <media:description>The number of people unemployed in the United States has risen for the first time since March.
It comes as some pandemic unemployment benefits are set to expire unless Congress renews them. 
But as Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo reports from New York, many jobless Americans are still waiting for money they were promised.

   <media:description>The United Nations is proposing an economic lifeline for people living in poverty during the pandemic. 
In a report, it says they should urgently receive a basic income that would cost developing nations a total of $199bn a month. 
To pay for this, the UN suggests a temporary debt freeze for 132 nations. 
They could then use that money to combat the effects of COVID-19. 
The UN predicts this could potentially help 2.7 billion people globally. 
It means they will not be forced to work and staying at home would reduce the risk of the virus. 
The UN says the pandemic has been particularly devastating for poor communities.  
 
Achim Steiner, an administrator at the United Nations Development Programme, talks to Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>The state of California's progressive stance on issues from climate change to immigration has long epitomised liberal opposition to President Donald Trump.

He in turn portrays those values as a betrayal of the US heartland and his supporters in the Republican Party

So what does this bitter ideological battle reveal about the choices facing Americans in the coming presidential election?

Earlier this year, for a special two-part report, People &amp; Power's Bob Abeshouse went to find out.

   <media:description>Latin America has turned into a COVID-19 epicentre.

It has 10 percent of the world's population, but in recent weeks has accounted for nearly half the global daily death toll. And Mexico is one of its worst-hit countries, with a death toll that has now surpassed Italy and Spain.

About one in five of its inhabitants live in the capital, Mexico City - a beehive perfect for any virus looking to spread. Despite that, many question whether its rise here was so inevitable, or if the region's second-most populous country simply got it wrong.

From the start, there have been questions: Why did Mexico test at one of the lowest rates in the world? Why was the quarantine so softly policed? And why did the country's president flout his own government's physical distancing guidelines?

Al Jazeera heads to the front lines with paramedics and medical staff at a public hospital's intensive care unit, and with stallholders in a mega-market that has become a COVID focal point. We also visit the food banks, where the country's poorest come for help as they try to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic.
