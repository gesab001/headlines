Lutfi's lawsuit had accused Britney's mom, Lynne Spears, of libel and her dad, Jamie Spears, of battery. It also accused her conservatorship of failing to pay him a 15% fee on the singer's income during the time he claimed to have been her manager.

Spruill is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept., saying that deputies fabricated a story that he shot at them and then falsely arrested him for attempted murder. He was in jail for six months after the Dec. 2019 incident and is now trying to put his life back together. Finding work as a trained welder is difficult for Spruill because his charges show up whenever a potential employer does a background check. He advises people to "be more cautious and stay woke. A lot of bad things happen to people that go under the radar." He went onto say "I hope to come out of it and bring awareness to it (the Sheriff's Dept.) and maybe someone else will be treated better." (Josie Norris / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
