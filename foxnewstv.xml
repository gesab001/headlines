The coronavirus pandemic and China's handling of the virus has worsened U.S.-China relations. As the U.S. attempts to flatten the curve and overcome the virus, the big question remains if China will be held accountable. Assistant Attorney General of National Security John Demers weighs in.

About 26 million Americas have filed for unemployment in the last five weeks with many frustrated they haven't received their money yet.
