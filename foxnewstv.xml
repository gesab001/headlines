Next Wednesday will be Attorney General Bill Barr's last day on the job, leaving the Trump administration with nearly a month left before the President leaves office. President Trump has said he is upset with Barr's handling of the election and the investigation of Hunter Biden's laptop. Jim Trusty, Former Justice Department prosecutor and now a partner at the Ifrah Law Firm, joins to discuss the attorney general's early departure, what it could mean for Hunter Biden and whether there is still hope for President Trump in the 2020 election.

President-elect Joe Biden hit the campaign trail on Tuesday for the first time since November in hopes to get Georgians to vote for Democratic Senate candidates in January. Director of the Fox News Decision Desk Arnon Mishkin weighs in on the high stakes runoff races, if President Trump and President-elect Joe Biden's involvement helps or hurts the races, which party he thinks has an advantage and more.

Plus, commentary by syndicated columnist and author of &quot;America's Expiration Date,&quot; Cal Thomas.
