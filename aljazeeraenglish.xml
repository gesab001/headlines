   <media:description>It's the middle of June in the Northern Hemisphere, schools are almost out and the traditional holiday season is upon us.
But what is traditional about emerging from a months-long global pandemic lockdown?
Travel restrictions are gradually being lifted in many countries, and tourist attractions are back on the itinerary - but there are so many catches.
Some European countries have now opened borders to each other but for now, that's it. Tourists from other countries will have to wait.
Others are welcoming visitors from nations that have the coronavirus under control... but health certificates, quarantines and other precautions might be needed. 
And going on holiday - if you can - is likely to be a very different experience, if we're all wearing masks and standing two metres apart.
So what changes are needed to make tourism sustainable? And do tourists even have the appetite to travel now?

   <media:description>Reform, defund, or dismantle? The death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police last month is raising big questions about how to improve law enforcement in the United States.

Public support for police reform has been growing in recent years, but meaningful change has proved elusive - and what that change would look like remains up for debate.

Amid nationwide protests, many top officials agree that at the very least, police accountability and oversight must increase. But some community leaders are pushing for more drastic changes, including reducing police budgets and redefining the role of law enforcement.

In Floyd's Minneapolis for example, the City Council has voted to disband the police department in favor of a more community-oriented agency “that actually keeps us safe,” President Lisa Bender said this week. However, critics argue that defunding law enforcement could lead to more crime, not less.

In this episode we ask, what should be done about America’s policing problem? Join the conversation.

   <media:description>The United States is demanding the immediate release of a former soldier jailed in Russia for spying. 
A closed-door court in Moscow sentenced Paul Whelan to 16 years in prison.
He says police planted a flash drive containing classified information while he was at a friend's wedding two years ago. 
The US ambassador in Moscow says the businessman is innocent and describes his secret trial as &quot;a mockery of justice&quot;.
Daragh McDowell, principal Russia analyst at the global consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft, talks to Al Jazeera.

   <media:description>Economic analysts say a new outbreak of the novel coronavirus risks China’s recovery.
A lockdown has been imposed on at least 20 neighbourhoods in the capital, Beijing, where dozens of new infections have been reported.
Chinese industrial output last month grew at its strongest rate since the virus was detected in December. 
But shop sales are slow as consumers remain cautious.

   <media:description>Many countries are reliant on seasonal workers to harvest crops, but many have not been able to travel because of lockdowns imposed amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
In Italy, farmers have banded together to get seasonal workers into the fields to save their businesses.

   <media:description>The killing of George Floyd in U.S. police custody has triggered anti-racism protests around the world.
Rallies in Britain highlighted discrimination against minorities, as well as Britain's colonial past.
Far right protesters held counter rallies after the statues of colonial figures and slave traders were removed.
People also rallied against racism and police violence in France.
And protesters in Belgium defaced statues of King Leopold II, who ruled Congo in the 19th century when tens of millions of Africans were enslaved and killed.
Can Europe and the U.S. learn from each other about how to deal with the legacy of racism?

   <media:description>A new domicile law for Indian-administered Kashmir is fuelling anxiety among people already enduring security restrictions imposed by India’s central government that have been criticised by UN experts.

For decades, Kashmiris had rights on education, jobs and land enshrined within legal codes that accompanied semi-autonomy. But that all changed in August 2019, when the BJP-led central government revoked the region’s special status, without any direct input from Kashmiris. The central government went further in March, introducing laws that dramatically expand who can live permanently in the newly-designated Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

The new rules allow Indian citizens who have lived in Jammu and Kashmir for 15 years to claim a 'domicile certificate' for residency benefits, as well as those who have studied there for seven years. Children of central government officials who worked in Jammu and Kashmir for at least ten years can also apply, even if they have never set foot in the territory. Kashmiris were not given an opportunity to vote for or against the new law, and local parties say the central government did not consult them over amendments to the measures.

Officials within the BJP-led central government say the domicile law will usher in &quot;equality and dignity for all&quot;. But people across Kashmir are worried that the new laws will clear the way for people across India to move into the region based on scant documentary proof, taking jobs and opportunities from indigenous Kashmiris. Legal scholars say the new domicile laws will encourage “demographic flooding” of Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir and render stateless indigenous Kashmiris who are unable to prove their residency and obtain a domicile certificate.

We'll look at how Kashmiris are reacting to the new domicile laws and their concerns for the future. Join the conversation.
