It's been over two months since the U.S. shut down its economy to try and flatten the curve of the coronavirus outbreak. Now states are slowly starting to reopen and attempt to get back to normal. But there is some debate about whether it's &quot;too soon&quot; to open back up. Bill Hemmer, anchor of Bill Hemmer Reports on the Fox News Channel and the Hemmer Time podcast weighs in on the impact of the virus, the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China and more.

While bars and restaurants are starting to finally open their doors, for some, unfortunately, it may be too late. The founder of Coyote Ugly Saloon, Liliana &quot;Lil&quot; Lovell and Coyote Ugly's general counsel Jeff Wiseman discuss how their company has coped with coronavirus and why reopening will be a struggle even if states give them permission to do so.

Plus, commentary by  Kat Timpf, co-host of the &quot;Tyrus and Timpf&quot; podcast.
