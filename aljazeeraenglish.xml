   <media:description>Brexit trade talks have plunged into crisis on the eve of a penultimate round of negotiations in London, after the United Kingdom warned the European Union it could effectively override the divorce deal it signed unless the bloc agrees to a free trade deal by October 15.

Tensions mounted on Monday, with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier saying he was &quot;worried&quot; about negotiations, and he will seek clarification from London about plans to renege on commitments.

The UK is reportedly planning new legislation that will override key parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement - a step that, if implemented, could jeopardise a treaty signed in January and stoke tension in Northern Ireland.

Sections of the internal market bill, due to be published on Wednesday, are expected to &quot;eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement&quot; in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs, the Financial Times newspaper said on Monday, citing three people familiar with the plans.

   <media:description>Saudi Arabia has reduced the sentences of eight people involved in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.
Last year, five of them were given the death penalty for the killing, but that has been overturned.
The court handed 20-year sentences to five people and three others were sentenced to between seven to 10 years, state media reported. The eight convicted were not identified.

   <media:description>Alexander Lukashenko insists he's not going anywhere, despite a month of protests against the Belarusian president's disputed re-election. On Sunday, tens of thousands of protesters ignored government warnings to demand a new vote, saying last month's election was rigged.
Police were seen dragging away or beating demonstrators.
Friends of a high-profile opposition leader, Maria Kolesnikova, say masked men abducted her.
So, how much longer can Alexander Lukashenko hold on to power?

Presenter: Imran Khan

Guests:

Jaroslav Romanchuk - Former Belarusian Opposition Presidential candidate

Franak Viacorka - Non-Resident Fellow, Atlantic Council

   <media:description>There are more than 6,000 distinct languages in the world today. But about 2,500 of them are at risk of becoming extinct, according to UNESCO. 

Some languages, for example the native Wiradjuri in Australia, are spoken by as few as 30 people – with limited national incentive to keep them alive. When they disappear, there is little historical record of their existence. 

It is estimated that in the next ten years at least 50 vulnerable languages will disappear. 

On this episode of The Stream, we’ll take a closer look at some of the world’s lost languages and meet the activists trying to save them.

   <media:description>Saudi Arabia has reduced the sentences of eight people convicted in the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, state media reported on Monday.

A court handed 20-year sentences to five people charged in the murder case, and three others were sentenced to 7-10 years, it said.

&quot;Five of the convicts were given 20 years in prison and another three were jailed for 7-10 years,&quot; the official Saudi Press Agency said, citing the public prosecution service.

The final court verdict comes after Khashoggi's sons said in May they had &quot;pardoned&quot; the killers.

Khashoggi went missing on October 2, 2018, while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish authorities later revealed he was murdered inside the consulate by a Saudi hit squad.

   <media:description>People across Mali are anxious over the country’s future in the wake of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita's resignation following a military coup. 

News of Keita's resignation was greeted with euphoria by supporters of the opposition June 5 movement that led popular protests against the government, but there are now tensions over the contours of transition back to civilian rule. And with people across Mali already facing food shortages, displacement and the threat of coronavirus, the continued uncertainty over Mali’s political future is another burden to bear. 

We ask: what happens next for Mali?

   <media:description>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is set to fight for his freedom in a British court after about 10 years of legal drama, as he challenges an attempt by the American authorities to extradite him on spying charges over the site's publication of secret US military documents.

Lawyers for Assange and the US government are scheduled to face-off in London on Monday at an extradition hearing that was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

US prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges adding up to a maximum sentence of 175 years.

His lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists at risk.

   <media:description>Nearly 300 Rohingya have come ashore in Aceh, on the northern tip of Indonesia's Sumatra island, authorities said, in one of the biggest such landings by the persecuted Myanmar minority in years, after a months-long voyage at sea during which more than 30 refugees are thought to have died.

The group, mainly women and children, were spotted at sea by locals who helped them land near Lhokseumawe early on Monday, according to Munir Cut Ali, head of Ujong Blang village.

&quot;We saw a boat coming ashore in Ujong Blang and so then we helped them land safely,&quot; Ali told the AFP news agency.

At least one member of the group - 102 men, 181 women and 14 children - was ill and had to be rushed to a local hospital for treatment, according to the area's military chief Roni Mahendra.

It was not immediately clear how long the Rohingya had been at sea or what type of vessel they arrived in.

   <media:description>Belarusian protest leader Maria Kolesnikova has been abducted by unidentified individuals in central Minsk, according to the Belarusian Tut.By media outlet, citing a witness.

Masked men took her and drove off in a minivan, said Tut.By.

The development on Monday came hours after security forces arrested 633 protesters following a mass anti-government rally on Sunday, the latest since the disputed August election.

Police in Minsk said they had not arrested Kolesnikova, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.

Kolesnikova is the last one left in Belarus of three female politicians who joined forces before the August 9 presidential election to try to challenge longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko.

   <media:description>Typhoon Haishen made landfall just north of the South Korean city of Busan on Monday morning, cutting power to homes and factories, toppling trees, and forcing trains to be cancelled and flights grounded.
Haishen has brought heavy rains and strong winds, but was downgraded from a Typhoon to a tropical Storm.

Al Jazeera’s Rob Mcbride reports from Pohang in South Korea.

   <media:description>A huge change is under way in Montenegro after pro-Serb and pro-Russian parties declared victory in parliamentary elections last week. 
Supporters of the pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists are worried about the change, now that their party will not be forming the government.

   <media:description>Colombia is easing some coronavirus restrictions after months of lockdown.
But many people are flouting some of the rules that are in place to keep people safe while mixing in public areas.
Officials in the capital, Bogota, have found new ways to keep order - using clowns who mingle with the crowds and remind people to follow the rules.

Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti reports from Bogota, Colombia.

   <media:description>Student-led demonstrations have been taking place in Thailand for months. 
The young protest leaders are using new methods to make their message heard, taking their efforts online as well as on the street.
They recently targeted advertisers on a news network they say is pro-government, urging their supporters to boycott companies running advertisements on the network.
And big-name brands have responded, pulling their advertising from the network.

Al Jazeera’s Scott Heidler reports from Bangkok, Thailand.
