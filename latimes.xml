Mary Nakamura received her stimulus payment on April 15. There's just one problem, she's deceased. The 96-year-old died about a year ago but her son Mason Nakamura, who handles her estate account, said his mother received a $1200 check. He wants to give that money back to the IRS, saying it doesn't make sense. Nakamura's mother is likely one of thousands who are deceased but received payments anyway. IRS experts said it's actually lawful for the dead to get stimulus payments and that it's not an error. The priority was put on getting payments out as quickly as possible and weeding out the dead would have likely delayed the process by weeks, if not months. (Allen J.

Robert A. Schuller on Sunday, April 12, 2020. Schuller is reviving a practice that launched his father to worldwide acclaim- the drive-in ministry. For the past four years, the younger Schuller has been preaching primarily on social media, providing daily sermons from his "church with no walls." The COVID-19 outbreak - and the loss of in-person fellowship - led him back to his roots. "People need a place to go to worship on Easter, " he said.

All the golf courses are closed in the desert communities. Declining to give his name, he said he's reading a novel by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Which seems very relevant during these times. Some of Nietzsche's famous quotes are, "To live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering," and "That which does not kill us makes us stronger." Also, "Without music, life would be a mistake."]]></media:description>
